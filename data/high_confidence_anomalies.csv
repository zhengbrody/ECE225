I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.",False,1,1,0,2

The faux hair is very shiny and looks literally like bad barbie hair.  It looks WAY better in the photos than in real life.  The color is horrific, in my opinion of course.  The streaks are like paint strips.  And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!  And you might think - well, maybe a little loss is to be expected?  Except this was handfuls and handfuls.  I literally dropped the whole thing right into the trash.  I would say this one is a pass for hair loss alone.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source.

Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 25,000 likes.

The scrub has a coarse texture which makes it better for exfoliating, yet I didn't have any troubles with it being too rough on my skin. It is very emollient and has a waxy feel to it.  Because of the waxiness, it coats the skin. I used some on my feet and they became a bit slippery on the tile shower floor.

Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes.

I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me.

The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft!

Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle.

They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn’t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I’m a busy mom, so it’s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,B015ZXMSFQ,4.0,"My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious.

It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like.

I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose.

It was not easy to get the bar across the ""combs"" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the ""brush."" I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8 since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on dry hair but even better on wet hair. I love the hard tines as it is like getting a massage on the scalp. The handle provides an okay grip but I would have preferred a silicone grip. Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design. Hair can be removed easily since the tines are flat with no ""ball"" tip.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this three stars is because of the hard time I had assembling the rod in place on each one, the lack of four holes for a secure fit, and the lack of silicone grip on the handle.

I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this.

What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive.

Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it’s High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2” due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we’re on the 25th day of Geologie’s 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I’m most impressed with- this hasn’t caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I’m sure it’s bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I’m not even sure how it does it, maybe it’s witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son’s for past x3 months and I’m actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn’t have a feminine vibe, nothing “fu-fu-“ to turn teen boys away from using “girl stuff!” Trust me, I’ve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can’t promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results.

(too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you’re norm is the “frozen gel look!” Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It’s feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear… It’s just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we’ve used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we’ve noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it’s not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel..

AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,B082PW35NV,5.0,"I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven’t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It’s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven’t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a “bite” to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don’t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress – my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they’re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It’s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.",True,1,0,1,2

Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they’d be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you’re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn’t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I’m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I’m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it’s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time.

Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.

ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!)

I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!",False,1,1,1,3

The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion.

It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.

AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,B000067E30,4.0,"Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.",False,1,1,1,3

It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007",False,1,1,1,3

I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays.

I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price.

But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too.

I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try.

But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word ""matte"" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all.

Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion).

I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style.

""This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‘poo is for you"". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look.

I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it).

The product once applied is like that eraser-- it is removing those ""marks"". What happens when you use an erase? You start to see balled up pieces of eraser mixed with the graphite/pencil marks. That is more or less what is happening here. Those balled up pieces are a mix of product, dirt, and cells. Rinse, and carry on with rest of your routine. It is a very gentle ""peel"".

My litmus test to a good mascara has been reduced to simply whether it irritates my eyes or not. As for lengthening, lifting, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. This DOES NOT IRRITATE (!!)

My lashes are well coated, making them look thicker, and there is a lift that I greatly appreciate as my lashes otherwise angle downward. Length is notable too. My lashes are nomrally ho-hum. Not thick, not thin, not long, more on short side, and angle down. This mascara is pleasing me. I dont care for make up except for mascara, but I rarely find one worthwhile.

The oil was thick, all cakds up around the topper, and the bulb dropper was rock hard. I was unable to squeeze it. I think the dropper had dry rotted, then that allowed air into the bottle, leading to a rancid product. It was evident not just based on looks, but also that super special aroma of a rancid oil. Too bad, as I love seed oils for use on body, face, and hair. This had to go directly into garbage. Not at all usable as something with anti-oxidants become PRO-oxidant when exposed to air.

AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B08D7TLV21,4.0,"I've only just begun using this, so this is a first impression review. I am fairly familiar with the active ingredients and understand how they work (and that they do work, so I expect this to continue that). The new part is the pearl extract, which has both immediate effect and longer term use benefit. I can attest to the immediacy, and it will be with using this for greater amount of time to determine if it a repurchase or not. As I learn more, I will share more. Here is a break down of what is in it and what to expect:<br /><br />BLANCHET GLAM PEARL RADIANCE CAPSULE SERUM is a supremely light weight gel serum with hint of floral scent from lavender, geranium, rose, and sandalwood. Barely detectable.  A little goes a long way. This weightless serum adds a mild level of healthy sheen. Korean Beauty emphasizes healthy skin, hydrated skin, supple skin, dewy, glowing skin. It is never matte. So while you could cover this with your foundation or powder, KB is all about letting natural skin shine through. The gentle, mild barely there sheen provides more of a glass look than a shiny look. Subtle. As for the rest... The primary active ingredients are NIACINAMIDE (2%) and ADENOSINE (.04%).<br /><br />NIACINAMIDE is a skin care work horse. It provides a variety of benefit to all skin types, ages, and concerns. It is a water-soluble vitamin (B3) that works with the natural substances in your skin to help improve skin barrier, fix past damage, visibly minimize enlarged pores, tighten lax pores, improve uneven skin tone, soften fine lines and wrinkles, diminish dullness, and strengthen a weakened surface. As I hone in on ingredients that pack the greatest punch, niacinamide has stood out as a must have ingredient in my skin care routine. I especially like it for its ability to brighten pigmentation. It also is one of few ingredients that work well with other ingredients without concern for contraindication or nullification. Skin care can get tricky, and this ingredient is just so easy to work with- so go ahead and use it with retinol, peptides, acids, etc. Niacinamide simply helps skin be healthy and look healthy and radiant. As with most skin care, it can take several weeks to several months of consistent use to see changes. This serum will help over time, but other ingredients provide an instant radiant glow.<br /><br />ADENOSINE is a rising star in anti aging products. There are studies that demonstrate that adenosine is an effective ingredient for improving the appearance of wrinkles, in both the eye and mouth area. Interestingly, adenosine directly affects the production of type I and type III collagen in the skin by binding to A2A receptors in fibroblast cells. So if it can help boost (or at least maintain) collagen, and help collagen from breaking down (collagen is what keeps our skin plump. Compare your 45 year old face to your 18 year old face, if your face now looks ""thinner"" despite no losing weight, it is the decrease of collagen that has produced that look). Since adenosine has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen, applying it topically can help to prevent (and somewhat even reverse) wrinkles. *thumbs up*<br /><br />80% FERMENTED PEARL EXTRACT is rich in amino acids and trace minerals that are highly moisturizing, soothing, and brightening. I must say, this is something that is new to me. Before this product, I had no idea that there was a use for pearl extract. It is used in topical skin care products as well as for use internally. I really dont know much about any of this, but a cursory search led me to a few interesting bullet points:<br />-Increases skin's collagen production<br />-Helps repair skin's damaged cells<br />-Lightens skin's tone and improves blemishes<br />-Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles<br />-Controls oil and shine<br />-Reduces pores and promotes smoother skin<br />-It has soft hues which shift subtly from direct to side views<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />Skin Brightening<br />Anti wrinkle<br /><br />Uses<br />High-intensity brightening lotion with 80% of fermented pearl extract in capsule technology<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />ACTIVE:Niacinamide,Adenosine<br />INACTIVE: water, dipropylene,  Glycol,1,2-Hexanediol,Agar,Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Synthetic Fluorphlogopite,Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891),Polyglyceryl-10Laurate,Polyglyceryl-10Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin,Hydrolyzed Pearl,Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Oil,Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,Glycerin,Propanediol Hydroxyacetophenone,1,2-Hexanediol ,Centella Asiatica Extract,Butylene Glycol,Propanediol ,Portulaca Oleracea Extract,1,2-Hexanediol Centella Asiatica Extract,1,2-Hexanediol ,Panax Ginseng Leaf/Stem Extract Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract,1,2-Hexanediol , Hydrolyzed corn starch Beta vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract,Glycerin,Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glutathione,Plankton extract,Disodium EDTA,Tromethamine Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Xanthan Gum",False,1,1,1,3

Sometimes I take a wash cloth to them, so these wipes are rather convenient when I am sitting in bed ready to lotion up but didnt take a wash cloth to them yet. These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br /><br /> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.",False,1,1,1,3
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B07DS4GPGX,4.0,"I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot- leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy looking. I added in this serum as I hoped to gain hair density or at least reduce loss (or reduce cycle frequency and/or duration). I dont have trouble growing my hair, I have trouble keeping it. So my hair is long, but much less dense than previous years. I transitioned from minoxidil to this. I wont do that again, as any gains I got from minoxidil were lost-- and I do contribute some of that to not using this as consistently as I did that. I'll explain what went into that below. This serum helped the condition of my hair and scalp, so I think it works well with minoxidil instead of in lieu of it. I likely wont continue with the serum for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. there was no instruction as to how to use this product. It is a dropper bottle, and I pretty much just used it like I did with minoxidil-- massaged whatever I pulled with dropper and distributed all over scalp, primarily at crown. Was this the correct way to do it? no idea. *<br /><br />2. It does say to apply to clean hair. Well, many of us do not wash our hair every single day. I have long curly hair that leans dry and there is no need to wash it daily. So I am either applying this to unwashed scalp daily or it only gets applied a few times a week.  Hence the lack of consistency. So right here it eliminates some would-be users if it has to be on a fresh washed scalp.<br /><br />3. the dropper is uncomfortable. I do not want to drop it from the dropper. I want to run it across the scalp so as to keep it from getting on my hair. The dropper is a little sharp feeling (at least my bottle that I received). I like the dropper style, and my thought is that if I were to buy this again, I would use a dropper from an old minoxidil bottle instead.<br /><br />4. How long should this bottle last? Since I had no idea how much I should use, I often wondered if I used too much or too little. Any new hair treatment needs to be given 4-6 months of consistent use to see results, if any. I know the shampoo and conditioner helped, and this serum has great ingredients that will help existing hair and scalp health.. but the inconsistency on my part from lack of instructions as well as expectation of using on fresh washed hair made it impossible to see if I could get benefit from it.<br /><br /> * ""It is best applied to damp hair after showering. We recommend visually splitting your scalp into 4 sections/quadrants. Depending on the amount of hair, use around 3-5 drops per quadrant. I like to drop into fingers and work into scalp. The remaining amount on your fingers you can work through your hair. It is perfectly fine to use the serum many times a day. That being said, it is important that the scalp/hair is clean"" (--I saw this written in the community question section of this page. Including this on box or in a leaflet would have been greatly helpful)<br /><br />The ingredients are of quality, the products work well together. I have since gone back to minoxidil, and once I have stopped the current shedding phase, I may buy another bottle to use as a support product. For that, I give it 4 stars.",True,1,1,1,3
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B08GSKRQKD,4.0,"I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face.

Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day.

Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion.

I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well.

While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used.

I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier.

Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.

For rating, I am right in the middle of neither really liking it nor really disliking it (ok, maybe leaning a more toward dislike for me). The ""3 stars"" include the fact the company (and their ingredient selections) seems of high quality and may be worthwhile to check out.<br /><br />I have mixed thoughts on this, so please bear with me as I try to explain.<br /><br />At first glance, the small container is packed to the brim with a dark brown, dry, granular looking substance. This is primarily a combo of coffee powder and cocoa powder. I thought it was going to be a rough scrub, and immediately thought that there is no way I would use that on my face. Since it says, ""for face AND body"" my plan changed  to use it on my body in the shower. However, the directions say to apply TO FACE, and allow to sit for 10 minutes/until dry. That isn't happening as a body scrub. In the shower.<br /><br />So now I am back to trying it on my face. It did not come with a spatula or spoon, so plan to use your own. Or scoop out with a finger.I have tried it by spooning out a bit of product and adding water, adding a hydrosol, and adding an oil. The latter makes it easiest to use through I do not know if it impeded the other ingredients. Also, it wouldn't dry with oil. But it did stay in place with oil.<br /><br />Any granular feeling quickly melted down, so I felt better about using it on my face. But still, not a fan of anything granular on face. Overall, I don't like it for my face- I only tried it once because that is all I could handle. . It felt like it left some powder behind. I felt compelled to rewash my face to get any remnants off. Meh.<br /><br />Body is fine (and is why I selected it for use). When used with all bases I mentioned, the result was a slightly oily feel. Not heavy, not greasy. Definitely a little bit of hydration/moisture. Ultimately not a fan of it for my face, but do like it enough for use on body. HOWEVER, I do not ""keep it on until it dries"" while I am using it.. in the shower. I just use it like a regular body scrub. I either add water to it, or oil. OR use a basic creamy body wash as the vehicle. Now that I think of it, even a body lotion would work (especially if you have one you dont love and want to use up). Once again, the oil (or body wash/ lotion) is easier to worth- I can work it all over body, massage it in, and as it rinses away once again that slightly oily feel is left behind (not greasy, not heavy, rather soft and light; rather nice).  Make sure to rinse shower as this will splatter brown all over.<br /><br />I like that the product is packed into a small jar container, and that it needs a base (water, hydrosol, etc) which can be good or bad depending on your preference. By needing to add your own, the product is more concentrated (not paying for added water,etc), but it lends just a tiny bit of inconvenience. Use in the shower is awkward. Use as a scrub mask is going to come down to preference. If you like a more granular feeling physical scrub/exfoliator this may not be for you. If you use more, you may get more of a scrub feel (I guess you could add sugar). I use less as I do not want a harsh physical scrub. For the shower, I prefer a greater scrub feel, so I use more. I am thinking now I may add this to another jar, add some cream or oil, and some added sugar for an easier to use shower scrub experience.<br /><br />Packaging is nice, and pleasant to look at.

So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good.

It doesn't come back up in burps like a fish oil can.<br /><br />I have been taking this for 2 weeks now. I did not immediately start with a full 2 caps does as I wanted to make sure that I could tolerate the new ingredients. I can. So then about a week in I began taking two caps. I know I have forgotten a dose or two, but I am through 2 of the six blister packs, and just starting my third. I am embarking on a multi pronged approach to my massive shedding cycles. I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an ""off shedding cycle"", or my approach is working. I don't want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks. BUT I'm not too far off, so maybe?! I am keeping track, so I will be back to update as I go.

Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, ""After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen"" I will need to continue to buy this.

AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B07RGZNDV4,5.0,"The ""Drop the Bomb"" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: ""Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine""! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won't even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn't grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my ""reapply"" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn't even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn't really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far.

When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea.

Not, ""made for USA but made in China"", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes"", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at.

AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B0859CYSTM,4.0,"Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.

I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, ""medium"" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.",False,1,1,1,3

I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far.

My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like.

For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker.

See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don't let this more expensive ""deplaning tools"" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, ""WAND"") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, ""deplaning"" in the description.

Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don't fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it ""deplaning"") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn't just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn't great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What's in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, ""deplaning blade"") in each handle (ie; ""wand""). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don't expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The ""wands"" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the ""instructions for use"" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don't like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.",False,1,1,1,3

The crush style straightener is pretty easy to use. It will take a little getting used to over using a flat plate straightener. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use it on my long, thick, wavy hair.. but I had no trouble with it. My first time using it was on not freshly washed hair- maybe a day or two after last shampoo. I used a little thermal protector, and then started swiping the brush through my hair. It took longer than using a flat plate to get hair smoothed out, but I do like the natural looking results.

Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions.

What I like about this set it's a spoof of Wayne's World and it comes with a Wayne's World cap, a wig, T shirt and an inflatable guitar. The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.<br />“Wayne's World"" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled ""Wayne's Power Minute"" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from ""Wayne's Power Minute""), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show ""live"" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first ""Wayne's World"" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season. The only thing I didn't like about the Cap is that it clearly looks like a woven Cap on the ad, but the Cap that I was sent is definitely a screen print which I guess is, OK?  ” NOT”.

All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!  I will never buy any other brand of razor again and I'll probably have this one for years to come...",True,1,0,1,2

If you compare ingredients to most setting spray that is all natural they are almost identical.<br /><br />The smell is light and flowery.

The under eye cream smells ok, somewhat medicinal, herbal, not bad but not the best either but I can handle it.<br /><br />You use those eye rollers to massage it into the skin which is neat and I personally like it since it does help firming the skin. I prefer to put it into the fridge prior to using it since the cooling helps even more, at least I found it does in my case.

I really didn’t like it at all and it makes it difficult using this product especially since that smell lingered for some time on top of it.<br /><br />The oil is on the lighter side, and even so it took a while to absorb and my skin felt greasy for some time.

When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with marula oil, rosehip oil, reishi mushroom, ginseng and cordyceps mushroom. This particular blend is supposed to help with wrinkles, acne scars and dry skin. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.",False,1,1,1,3

The box that it comes in is rather beautiful and the bottle itself is also very classy looking. The bottle itself is a pump dispenser.

The toner is a liquid formula that is on the thicker side with a hint of gel in it almost.<br /><br />This toner contains polyphenols which are actually micro nutrients and good for you, I know it sounds bad so I had to look it up. It also contains sea buckthorn fruit oil that helps brighten the skin complexion and recover from skin fatigue. It contains lily flower extract that helps moisturize the skin and nourish the skin and cherry on top, it contains no parabens.<br /><br />So now when you use it, you notice it has an interesting consistency, somewhat between watery and gel like and it bubbles when you dispense it. It has a very pleasant scent that I really like a lot and this fragrance lingers quite a bit which I am all in favor of. I feel that it nicely moisturized my skin. It didn’t irritate my skin or anything and worked nicely for me. All in all I am very happy with this toner.",False,1,1,1,3

It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest.

It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this.

I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.",False,1,1,1,3

I was a bit disappointed by the colors really, but then again, for the price can I really say anything about that? There weren’t really any nudes in there.<br /><br />The lipsticks were easy to apply but not that creamy. However they feel ok on the lips. They are not very sticky or anything but also don’t feel super smooth or creamy on the lips either. They feel just ok really. They don’t taste or smell of anything. Their staying power is ok, they wear off as you eat and drink like a lot of lipsticks do really. So considering these costs $10 for 12 of them, they are not horrible. They feel ok on the lips, the color range is limited in my eyes but they are not bad at all, all considering. Keeping everything in mind, I am rating them at 3 stars.",False,1,1,1,3

They get the job done and protect me while I am out and about and need to be protected. It is a strange world right now but I am glad we have ways to get these kinds of masks right now.

It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while.

With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue.

You can use this on its own or mix it with your moisturizer or foundation if you want.<br /><br />So this is a high quality product and worth every penny in my eyes. When you use it you will notice the strong essential oil scent and this is why I am torn. It is just a bi too almost medicinal to me. It is a scent that in my eyes should be in a massage parlor in the essential oil diffuser healing you of something. So for me it was just rather strong but thankfully it does not longer on your face too long.<br /><br />The oil is not too thick and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It leaves a slight oily residue on your face and I don't fault it for that since it is an oil. However, if you give it about 10 minutes or so, that oily residue disappears and you feel just soft and smooth skin. Absolutely amazing in my eyes. I love how my face felt when I used that to be honest and was a bit shocked.<br /><br />So I love how it makes my face feel and look, I just need to get over the scent but since you really don't smell it on your face for long I think I can handle it.",False,1,1,1,3

Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer.

AHTLWVDXSMG5YMVMEIWWOU6XBZMA,B07ZQ1QXK7,4.0,"I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up.

The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,B08BMV4C42,5.0,"As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.",False,1,1,1,3
AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,B08BMYPHD2,5.0,"I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.",False,1,1,1,3

Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.

The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.

There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.

The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,B078W6XC3C,5.0,"We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.

It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get.

Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well.

MelodySusie® has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers.  Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose.  The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty.  The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate around the entire piece and grungy mildew and such is reduced from forming.  Don't forget to dust, though.  The exterior edges are beveled, giving them a very finished appearance, unlike those sharp edges on many similar products in the marketplace.<br /><br />Included with this organizer are two additional pieces, each is the same dimension as the interior of the top ridge of the chest organizer, so you can decide which one you want to put on top and which one you want to put next to the main component.  Or you can separate them entirely and use the top of the organizer to put items and use the two multi-sectioned components separately.  You could line them up side by side along a dresser top and have more width rather than extended height.<br /><br />I love the assorted sizes of the sections and the angles top of the shorter of the two pieces.

I’m now 66 years old and have been using only La Prairie products for my face since 2009/10. My face looks better than ever because of it. This item in particular is a very gentle, easy to apply and use, facial cleanser that doesn’t require any water or actual washing process. It goes on a cotton pad (not the balls!), and not too much either, and you gently wipe your face and eye lids going in a circular motion - and always apply outwards and upwards. This will help your skin from being pulled down, which can cause more wrinkles. The company has changed the exact name of the product, but it’s the same (only an improved version) as it always has been. For me, I use this as the first step in my nightly facial ritual - which is to cleanse the face. I follow with other products in stages, finishing up with the moisturizer (one for the face and a different one for the eyes). My rating of this being sold online is hard, since it’s a wonderful product, however it’s outrageously overpriced for what’s a ‘trial size’ and ‘free’ gift, given out with purchases of a full size La Prairie item (depending on how much you spend, and where you buy, it might be just one of multiple free trial size items). The FULL size of this item is about $100 USD, and it’s around 8 ounces +/-. The bottle is probably 8” high and a couple inches wide at least. So part of my rating is based on the product itself and the other part is on the price for this size.

The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion.

This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller.

It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons:  By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo.

I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)

I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.

He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect.

Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end.

Plus lots of baking competitions and romance.

It lasts quite a while or until you eat something, then you need to reapply. But I put this on before I go out and it lasts for hours.

I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.<br /><br />The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it.

The felt tip is more hardened which makes its SUPER easy to control and place on the eyelid, whereas other liquid liners have softer felt tips which are floppy and they bend easy leaving you with having to press lightly so you don't mess up your straight line. This E.L.F liner is opposite of ALL that, its hard but not TOO hard that it doesn't glide precisely with your stroke. It has a PERFECT sized super thin tip which allows me to give my cat eye a precise small line finish at the corner of eye, it's perfection!<br /><br />My most FAVORITE part of this liquid eyeliner is that it does NOT get cakey, if I want a thicker more pronounced look, I can go over the same line several times and it doesn't cake up. I mean sure if you're gonna put 10 layers on, I'm sure it'll eventually cake, but building  with 3 layers, no cake! First time I tried to do thicker line, I was so nervous not wanting to mess up my entire eye makeup, but I had faith and gave it a try and was SHOCKED that it didn't get thick and cakey, and it still looked like I only had 1 layer of eyeliner on.<br /><br />Did I mention it stays put! I'll sometimes get watery eyes in the corner of my eyes, and this magic liner doesn't smudge, doesn't rub off, it could be that my make up setting spray helps, or it could be the eyeliner, but whatever it is its definitely some sort of sorcery. Haha.... But regardless with the insanely affordable price, you WON'T be disappointed!!!<br /><br />It removes SUPER easy with make up remover, or just soap and water, I always wash my face, then use make up remover to get any remaining make up off, and the eyeliner always seems to be gone after just soap and water.<br /><br />Truly the best bang for your buck!!!!",True,1,0,1,2

It says universal, but I would still take measurements to make sure it'll fit yours if it isn't a Bio Ionic brand because they are not ever all universal.<br /><br />The part that attaches to your hair dryer is not a hard plastic- it is rubbery (but firm) so it slides onto your hair dryer but doesn't &#34;click&#34; into place. I think that's why they say it's universal because this allows for some difference in the size of your dryer. But still do your research and compare your hair dryer to the size of the Buttercup hair dryer because it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />You can also twist the diffuser to open up the vents or close them to control the air flow (see pictures).

The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different.

I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book [[ASIN:0743292561 You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)]].  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.<br /><br />Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.<br /><br />I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.

It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set.

Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we’re NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I’ve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you’ll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke? This is a set of TWELVE (12) nails – 10 different sizes! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />Unlike the model hands – I don’t wear my nails OVER the edges of my finger. That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with – and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being “fake”, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea?

There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I’d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price – I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me.

I tried one and found it to be nice but not as skin softening as some of the bigger ones I've tried.

At most it removed a top layer of dead skin making my skin feel softer (and dryer), but after rechecking my pores with a magnifying mirror (if you want to hate yourself buy one and then freak out at your skin, lol) there was no real difference.

Other teas and sleep formulations such as melatonin and valerian supplements just don't do the trick.<br />For me, it's more about the delightful taste. Slightly floral, slightly sweet. Yes, it does relax me and is helpful as part of a nighttime ritual, but not as much as my spouse. We both love it but for different reasons.<br /><br />And I just adore the look of the canister.

He shed those beautiful tail feathers every year, and even though he is long gone I still have some of his gorgeous plumes. Peacock feathers are not harvested from the animal, you simply pick them up as they are naturally shed.<br />This set arrived in a plastic bag. When I pulled the pieces out, there were three peacock feather pieces and one headband. Each feather piece has a rhinestone accent at the bottom. One is all rhinestone, one is a pearl surrounded by rhinestones, and one is a London blue stone surrounded by rhinestones.<br />Of the two larger pieces, one has an alligator clip hot glued onto the felt backing, and one has a strip of grossgrain ribbon glued to the back. Although I'm not sure, I suspect that it was at one time glued to the headband, or they leave it to the consumer to glue it to the headband. I tried to push the end of the headband through the middle of the ribbon, thinking that perhaps it could slide on, but it is glued completely, you can't slide it onto the headband.<br />The smaller piece also has an alligator type clip of the same size as the larger clipped piece.

They only open up like that when they're trying to impress someone, and he certainly was never impressed by any of my guests. At the time I also had a miniature pig. That peacock was so in love with the pig that whenever she came near him he would spread out his feathers and shake them hoping she would notice and return his love. Of course that never happened, the pig could care less.

I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things.

I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year.

I wound up only opening the ""A"" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the ""B"" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is ""Almost Friday,"" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept ""Blush for Me,"" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, ""Red for Me,"" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.

AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,B07GDBN9LB,5.0,"My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.",False,1,1,1,3
AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,B00KW4EF6Y,3.0,"NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.",False,1,1,1,3
AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,B0001ZI0BU,4.0,"After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.",False,1,1,1,3

I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls.

Long story short, go easy on yourself and do not massage too often. I would suggest about four times a week as a maximum.<br /><br />The cream itself is nice.

Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.

The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.

The white and black have bent brushes, and the white polish is a bit dried out but not the worst, kind of reminds me of using white-out before they changed the formula and it got all watery and they changed to a sponge applicator from a brush.  The black one is awful - it's literally just clumps of dried out polish with some occasional damp spots.  The blue one is okay, the polish is alright, but I wouldn't recommend using the brushes that came with these but buying a separate skinny brush for line work or whatever it is you want to do.<br /><br />I should mention I have been using them to fix an enameled piece of jewelry as opposed to doing nails, as that's what the jeweler recommended (nobody local repairs enamel resin and buying enamel is very expensive and you end up with a ton leftover), so a jeweler I trust recommended nail polish with a good resin sealant and that's what I've been doing.

It's smooth and not cakey, it blends well, feels weightless, and stands up to sweating and long work days with great shine prevention and it doesn't come off easily (a little when you blow your nose etc). I do not like the porcelain doll look and this works well for me for evening out tones.  I am 35 and have very sensitive skin, several minor facial scars, and occasional adult acne and this doesn't have any negative effects on my skin at all. It washes off easily with gentle face wash. It allows for a few spot touches of stick concealer, blends well, and holds well. Mine arrived with no breaks/cracks and the sponge works well.

This oil is food grade, cold pressed. It is a lighter weight than their avocado oil, but it works just as well. I use this on my son who is two to help his skin retain moisture (he has severe eczema). I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp. His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized. I use it on his scalp also once a week. I massage it through his hair and let it soak in while he's playing in the tub and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal. It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper. It doesn't have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him. It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side. We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months so it lasts a while compared to a gel baby oil (we go through one of them a month if we use it).  A little bit goes a long way. This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil. For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  If it's for eczema we have tried it.

I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish.

It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair.

Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless.

But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro ""lift proof"" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes.

It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel.

AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,B08Y7HV8CQ,4.0,"When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",False,1,1,1,3

This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. ""bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?"".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love with💖<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450°) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner.

While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up.

It has a more upscale look and feel to it, plus adds a battery gauge to show the charge level. However, the shave quality is the same – OK, but not a standout.<br /><br />The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it’s more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and ‘shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars).

AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,B007WFZ0XI,5.0,"I hate winter for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that my hands get so dry that I get cracks at my fingertips. It’s annoying and painful, especially at night. I’ve tried all sorts of moisturizers without much success. The best results (if you can call it that) have been from using petroleum jelly, but that’s messy and it still doesn’t work well.<br /><br />This argan oil, however, has been hugely effective. It gave me results right from the first day, and over the course of just a few days I can see noticeable healing of the skin cracks. No more pain and my hands feel far better than any other treatment I’ve tried.<br /><br />The product comes very nicely packaged, with a nice box filled with shredded packing material to keep the glass bottle safe in transit. It also makes for a very nice presentation should you want to give this as a gift. The bottle comes with a dropper and a “spritz” head. The latter is my only quibble – the spray head didn’t work well at all, and made sort of a mess when using it to dispense the oil. I replaced it with the dropper and had much better results.<br /><br />The oil itself has little or no scent. You need very, very little for results – I use about 1-2 small drops per hand, and that’s more than enough. It spreads easily (as expected given that it’s oil). It does take a few minutes to soak in – my hands are very greasy when I first apply it, but after a few minutes the greasiness goes away. The sheen from the oil stays around longer, but that too dissipates after 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />This can be used for a wide range of applications including face, body and even hair. It comes with a good amount of information to help explain how/where to use it, and how the oil was processed.<br /><br />I’m very impressed with this oil – it’s the only product I’ve ever tried that totally worked to solve my dry/cracked hands. It’s not cheap, but well worth the price if you need a highly effective moisturizer. Highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",False,1,1,1,3

It appears to be their response to the Oral-B Floss Action line of brushes that have a ""paddle"" to help get between teeth. This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.<br /><br />I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean's bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.<br /><br />But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I'm a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.<br /><br />These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.<br /><br />If you're a ProResults user these are well worth trying out. If you have tender gums you may want to alternate between the HydroClean and the ProResults (or, as I do, with the Oral-B. The Oral-B also makes a super soft brush if you have very sensitive gums.

It’s a nice box, again, offers a good number of items for a gift, and is done nicely enough in box set up and presentation it would be well received. Second, the items in it are a good range of “quality” so I think it’ll be appreciated. What I am saying: the brush, comb, bag, scissors, and guard are decent, but not great quality. You can get better quality, but for working needs and for a gift, this is pretty good. But, for example the scissors feel a bit cheaper. But they will get use as long as they cut well enough. I’m not big into using a guard, but this one is like others I’ve had. The included bag is decent, but I’d never use it; if traveling or moving my stuff I’d use a toiletry bag. The brush is not as nice as others I have, but it’s useable and gets the job done. Same with the comb. That brings us to the shampoo, Conditioner, and oil. NOTE: I have extremely sensitive skin, so this review is based on my experience from that standpoint. I like a range of scents or items to keep my beard in good shape, but I have a far more difficult time finding things that work and are okay on my skin. I have only used these items once, but that’s all it takes to know. I come away happy - they all worked and NO reaction. I used the shampoo and conditioner in the shower today and they not only had a nice, light scent, but I was bale to let it sit on the beard for a few minutes each, having no issues with skin and liking the smell. The beard felt soft following and I liked how they worked overall. Next, the oil. I believe it is claimed to be used for “beard growth,” and maybe it’ll help with that. My beard is decent, but I do have spots that could use thickening, so again, I keep an eye open for options. However, there is no way to know if it’ll work for that for a few weeks if not months. So until then, it again did fine on my skin - not a single ounce of negative reaction. The sect is light, so it’s nice to smell, but one (my wife) has to get up close to smell it. I do like it that way, so it doesn’t bug my sinuses or overwhelm.

I do tend towards lighter or no scents, but have found some that work alright for me. But with or without scent, I can still have issues. In the end, it’s how my skin handles anything that is the bottom line for me. In this case, this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils works well for me and so far, I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I use a derma roller a couple times a week to help with hair in my beard and front of my head. At this point I then add a beard oil to these locations to help stimulate growth. Without doing major testing with all the elements, like a control group (area) of my head, it’s hard to say what works and what doesn’t. I feel like the derma roller has a large part in how well growth or at least slowing of loss goes. But, I have also come to believe some of these oils available do play a supportive role. To that point, I won’t be able to speak about this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils  for awhile.

We have suction cups (bought on Amazon) we were able to use - I looped that part of the bib onto them, which worked, but not designed for this, they would fall off. I’ll end up taping them to it - at least that way I’ll be able to use it.<br />7. It fit me fine. It felt fine - just like a haircut cape.

The handle is also well made and tight to the brush (no wiggle).  Brush cleans up and dries soft and pliable.  It is a #4 size which is on the larger size for a lot of nail art.  This is probably best for solid designs or applying top coats and not for fine detail or complicated designs.  My daughter uses it to apply latex masks and peel off base coats.,False,1,1,0,2

It takes very little pressure to get them to flex and as far as using this to scrape your teeth... well you would get almost no scraping.  This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums.  I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring.

AE6PIIY7MY6OQJKTMSFRVKTXO36Q,B001LY7FRK,5.0,"Saw this puppy discussed a lot on various shaving sites. They all said that you have to watch the YouTube videos to get the right technique for lathering. I watched a couple and have been trying this now for the past several weeks. I must have tried close to 40 different soaps, creams and sticks from the most expensive to the not so expensive. This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.Certainly in the top quintile. Why 4 stars? I have tried every variation to get a lather but there is no getting around that this is the most difficult soap I have ever tried. Too much water, too little water it seemed impossible to get it right the first time. No matter what I tried it seemed to either be too foamy and thin or not enough water to generate a lather. It's as if the gremlin in the soap puck was contrary enough to defeat whatever I tried until the 2nd or 3rd try.<br />Bottom lime- With effort and persistence it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my ""go-to"" product. I'll stick with may favs: Kiss My Face, Cella and Proraso cream.<br />UPDATE:<br />Gave it another try with a little more patience. It seems that the end product you want is a little on the thick creamy side and not really a ""lather"". If you wet your brush, turn it over and let all the water drip out that you can,then you apply brush to soap and be patient and determined you will get the thick rich cream that will do the trick. One other tip I found after you apply the cream to the face let it sit for about 20-30 seconds before you apply your razor. You will then get the greatest glide you will experience. Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.I would give it 4 1/2 stars, and not 5, if I could because of the difficult lathering.<br />FURTHER UPDATE<br />After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it. Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation. I originally rated it a 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating. Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.",False,1,1,1,3

Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.

The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.

For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!",True,1,1,1,3

The other kind they make (the non-exfoliating kind) went through phases - first it was exfoliating, then they got bad reviews because it was TOO exfoliating (which I absolutely loved about it), then they removed ALL of the exfoliation and got bad reviews because there wasn't any exfoliation any more... and finally they got it together to have two varieties, one without any exfoliation, and one with exfoliation - this one.  And the other one is now stuck with a 3 star review average just because of that mix-up.<br /><br />At first I was nervous that even with the exfoliation back (this one), it would not be as good as it was before when it had the exfoliation originally, because it used to be oatmeal for the exfoliation, and now it is coffee grounds.  I even sent them a note asking why they didn't use oatmeal any more, and they said it was because the oatmeal version would fall apart in the Amazon warehouses.  But I tried the coffee ground exfoliation - and even though it isn't quite as good - it's still great.  This soap beats any other I've tried to purchase, and I have purchased about 10 brands through Amazon that all said they were exfoliating.  Only one of them was exfoliating enough, and I like this one better.  (I forget the name of that other brand right now; I'm at my computer.  If someone really wants to know, add a comment and I'll dig it up.)  I really need a very strong exfoliating soap, and this one actually is strong enough.

AGUGTCTCOHWX27GP4HY7DXJWA42A,B001LY7FRK,5.0,"After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone's word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &#34;convenience&#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I'm feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I've tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell's is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I've used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I'm not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I've heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can't really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..<br />  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) and reticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it's been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I'm guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.<br />  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren't looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  One word:  I wouldn't spring for the dish because I am cheap.  You might not be.. But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering.. Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..",False,1,0,1,2

Since the unit has no automatic shut-off when charging is completed, you have to keep an eye on it to avoid a problem.  That is my only gripe about this unit.  Not too many people have the time flexibility to watch it for the two hours (or less) it needs to charge.<br /><br />While it only comes with 3 attachments that is all you really need.

The scent also is delivered in a convenient spray which me and Bobby both like. The cologne actually smells very nice on him. It's a sort of woodsy, citrus masculine scent and you can definitely smell oranges and ginger in it. The One Cologne describes the scent as &#34;Coriander, Grapefruit, Cardamom seed, Tobacco, Basil, Cedar, Ambre, Ginger, Orange Blossom.&#34; Some of those things I have no idea what they smell like, but I'd say this not really a musk based scent but it smells really yummy on Bobby. It takes a little more spray than the original version The One Cologne, however, it's about 1/3 the cost, so I won't complain. It's still pretty strong with a couple of sprays being all he needs. As far as wear, it lasts a long time. It's sensual/manly in it's scent and he said he received several complements on the cologne.

After all, no one wants to look older or tired. I try all kinds of skin care products and really work hard at keeping my skin in good shape, so I decided I'd give this a try.I was speaking to a friend of mine recently whose skin always looks gorgeous. I asked her what she did to look so good? She is considerably older than me, but has no wrinkling and very pretty skin. She told me that she visits a dermatologist regularly and that she uses a retinol cream and that she pays 60.00 for just a small tube, plus the cost of the doctor visit. Now I am not sure of the strength of the retinoI cream she is using is, and I noticed this is 2.5% so I think that's a pretty effective dosage.The product came in a 1.7 fluid ounce moisturizer. I noticed that the retinol moisturizer also had Vitamin E & B5, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Propolis and shea butter. So I thought about Vitamin A or retinol and what it does for the skin. Vitamin A stimulates and thickens the dermis where collagen, blood vessels and elastin are thereby reducing wrinkles and increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Vitamin A actually expands the deposit of collagen in the skin; therefore slowing down the normal aging breakdown of your collagen and elastin. I've also read when studying skin care (and I really researched it) that Vitamin A increases blood flow and reduces the symptoms of rosacea, helps heal wounds more quickly, repairs cells in the skin and optimizes UV protection, exfoliates to make the skin more smooth, supple and even and even decreases melanin granules reducing brown spots and pigmentation. Vitamin A decreases sebum (oil) thereby treating acne very well and even helps with the eradication of precancerous lesions of the skin and improves hydration. Skins miracle healer!My mother has always used vitamin E. She is in her 70's and still has beautiful skin and is very selective about what she puts on her skin. I've read that Vitamin E has been used in skincare for so long that it sometimes gets passed over for newer, more exotic-sounding ingredients that are sometimes advertised or added to products. But Vitamin E is a highly beneficial ingredient, a strong defense against free radicals and the damage the environment does to the skin. When it’s combined with other antioxidants, It is an exceptional line of defense for your skin.The product is very good quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't leave your face shiny or greasy and seems to absorb within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too tight. There is no build up or product residue. This product has a  nice smell, light and soothing, and is quite easy to use. It's good that the items come in a pump, because exposure to air effects good quality ingredients. A little goes a long way, and the product seems to be lasting a good long time. I use many of Majestic Pure products, and I have had excellent luck with them all and no issues. This moisturizer already is reducing fine line and wrinkles in my skin. It really helps to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. I use this moisturizer on clean skin and I let it soak in, and use under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the cream soak in. This anti aging skin cream keeps your skin supple and moisturized.

AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,B0169Y84JE,5.0,"We are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin.

AFVQTQM23HW36W655KNBHZKAUPLQ,B00J7QCNDU,4.0,I like this DMSO product because it doesn't stink so bad. I use it in combination with another aloe vera pain relieving gel and it works.

Then wash and rinse your hands thoroughly after use. Care must be taken when using this product but nothing to be afraid of if common sense is used.

AF7PP5CBJENRLG6K4VDGHBQXVB4Q,B000GBICYE,5.0,"Until a year ago, I never liked the idea of owning an electric toothbrush: I'd owned several cheap ones and never liked any of them. Then I figured that I'd try one again about a year ago and so I chose the Sonic Spinbrush by Arm & Hammer. I chose the Spinbrush because it had a large brush, which I thought meant less time/effort brushing my teeth.<br /><br />The Spinbrush worked pretty well, but the large brush head gagged me horribly. Because of this, I decided to give the Oral-B Vitality a try and I like it much better. The first reason I prefer the Vitality is because it has a much smaller brush head (you don't need a large brush with an electric toothbrush, since the toothbrush is doing all the work.) The smaller brush head also allows me to reach places the larger Spinbrush cannot reach, because it's too big. The Vitality is easier to maneuver in your hand as well, thanks to the smaller handle base.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like about the Spinbrush is how it would click off automatically after 2 minutes (I don't think all models of the Spinbrush do this, though.) The Vitality purposely sputters after 2 minutes for it's timing function, but then continues it's normal operation after a second or two. I still find this annoying, but at least I don't have to remove it from my mouth, dripping with toothpaste, just to turn it back on. And if I finish early, the Spinbrush required me to punch the button twice to stop it (again, something not easy to do with a vibrating toothbrush in your mouth), whereas the Vitality only requires a single button push. These two things alone make the Vitality much more convenient.<br /><br />I also think the Vitality is more powerful then the Spinbrush. The reason you had to push the button on the Spinbrush twice was so you could use it at a lower speed if necessary, but I never found that necessary at all. I prefer the more powerful Vitality, because it feels like it's cleaning better by not slowing down if I push too hard.<br /><br />About the only thing I liked better about the Spinbrush was that it had an indicator light on the base to tell you it was receiving power (I think it gauged the charge, too, but that was never a problem for me.) I'm not sure if that's even important, but it is something I tend to prefer with rechargeable items. Other than that, I love the Vitality and I much prefer it over the Spinbrush. Now I can brush my teeth without gagging and I am thankful for that.",False,1,0,1,2

Please note that you won't get many full-size polishes to fit, though the Essie square type bottles make it easier to get as many in as possible.

The bottom portion is deep, but if you fill it with powder, it over covers the puff too much and ends up getting everywhere, and there’s no way to shake it off because the puff fits tightly into the deep portion and there’s no way to shake off the excess powder. There’s a middle piece with a center knob thing, which is hard to get out because it fits tightly metal to metal, and I have to use my nail to separate it from the bottom portion little by little, or powder goes everywhere, and even doing it slowly, powder spills. I’ve tried putting powder in the center piece, but the knob thing gets in the way, so I have to use the sides of the puff to get powder from the edges, but THATS better than pouring powder in the bottom portion though, because the puff is stored in that area also, and will get covered in powder, which is overkill. The puff literally has to rest on all the powder if you fill it (Don’t!). It’s just not made for easy use, and powder ends up in places I don’t want it, like on any surface you place the container and center knob thing tray. The cost is okay, if it was functional. It just doesn’t make much sense, other than looking cute if you choose a color you like. I just wanted to dip a puff in a little powder for a light dusting after a shower, and this contraption is just more trouble than it’s worth.

For the amount I used which is pretty standard across the board with all conditioners I've tried, this conditioner is rated at 5/5 for slip<br />Moisture: Next to none but that isn't a real issue due to most of the oils being found in Keeva's tea tree oil shampoo<br />Standout Ingredients: hydrolyzed keratin ( protein ), argania spinose ( Moroccan argon oil ), cetearyl alchol ( fatty alcohol )<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cocos nucifera ( Coconut Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient, however it is featured as an ingredient on the front of the bottle.<br />Melaleuca alternifolia ( Tea Tree Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient either.<br />Both of these oils is on the front of the bottle being featured however, the product doesn't list the oils as ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this to be a quality conditioner even better than some brands found in salons.

As a person whose been using shea butter for well over 10 years for ecezma treatment I can say that this shea butter is a quality product. Although it is a quality shea butter, the way it has been processed left the butter very grainy and not as creamy as I was expecting. It is a thick, heavy butter that is solid at room temperature and has a lot of use for hair and body purposes. It is sourced from an area in Africa that doesn't produce a real rancid smelling butter. It smells distinctly like shea but not like the shea sourced from more eastern countries. The butter when applied to the skin feels thick and heavey but that isn't a problem for me.

This isn't an iron I'd honestly recommend and the price the company charges full price is outrageous for the quality of this iron.<br /><br />My hair texture is 3C/4A and it is relaxer free.  It requires high heats to lay flat.  All of my irons is set to 450 degrees when in use.  Before any flat ironing can begin I start with clean freshly shampooed and conditioned hair. I  then blow dry, prestreching it so that it is easier to iron out.  I use a blow out cream which also protects my hair from heat damage and a vented brush when blow drying. After I'll apply a argon oil serum and a frizz busting serum to my hair.  These oils aide in getting my hair to lay flat with out any frizz.<br /><br />Iron snagged my hair upon first use. I thought that maybe it was user error but it wasn't as the second time I ran the iron across a different section of hair  it was snagged. I also had issues with my iron staying on.  The placement of the on and off switch makes it very easy to turn this iron on and off while in use. The iron didn't even stay plugged in when I was using it.  I was constantly giggling the cord to get it to turn back in.  This iron doesn't glide down a section of hair well.  It is very choppy thus leading to the snagged hair I spoke of earlier.  The iron does swivel while in use making it easy to use.  It goes up to 450 degrees but it's very difficult to maintain any temperature selected on this iron.<br /><br />I don't recommend this iron simply due to the fact it snags at hair.

I am 54 years old and after the first night I used it, I woke up the next morning and my face was red and a bit swollen.  At first I thought maybe I was having an allergic reaction.  I noticed after one use my skin was much smoother, as if the top layer of dead skin came off.  I gave my face a few days of a break, as this product seems to be a strong one, and reluctantly tried it again.  I did not have the same reaction with the redness and swelling.  So I kept using this product, but as it is a strong one, I use it only 2-3 times a week.  After about a couple of weeks using it, I discovered all kinds of undesirable things coming out of the pores of my skin, I developed little pussy sores and pimples, but the pimples were not like the regular pimple, these were deep and what came out was really think and sometimes hard.  Instead of having what I thought was an allergic reaction, I think this product was pulling impurities out of my skin and detoxing it.  I also had a couple of small, sebaceous cysts on my forehead and after about a month of using this product, they were gone!  I was told by a plastic surgeon the only way to get rid of them was surgery but I didn't want the scar on my forehead so never had anything done about them, I had them for years.  To this day, the cysts are gone.  My skin no longer reacts as if impurities are being pulled out.

And rarely did I really want the hair on my legs to reach that amount of stubble.  Not to mention the pain that is involved with epilators.  Yes, I am a weenie.<br /><br />This model of the Braun Silk Epil removes much shorter hair.  It claims to remove hair that is as short as a grain of sand (0.5mm).  I personally find it requires it to be a bit longer than that to grip; but it does do a much better job of reaching short hair than others I've tried.  It has a pivoting head which lets it work around all your body contours.  A light on the unit allows even the palest, finest hairs to be visible.<br /><br />In addition to hair removal, this epilator refines your skin.  A sonic massage system and high-density brush scrub away old skin cells.  This exfoliation helps to stimulate the regeneration of surface skin cells in order to create a smoother skin tone.

My biggest complaint is that I have a round face so I NEED bangs or fringe or something. A hairline on a non-lacefront makes me look even ROUNDER and that's not the look I'm going for! Most wigs require a lot of trimming and shaping to give me the look I want.<br /><br />I love long hair but not every day. So ... i thought I'd try this baby. Not only is the hairline beautiful but the color is perfect, the weight is amazing and the length is just right ... not too long like many are. I'll cut the lacefront eventually but these pictures are literally how it looks just plopped on my head, with my own hair peeking out. If anything, I might try to give it more volume because i love big hair but ... a few bobby pins, a wide-tooth comb and I'm SET.<br /><br />This wig is beautiful.

I prefer to keep it folded, wet it, add some soap or shower gel, and rub/scrunch it together until a lather forms. I used it folded on my body, and then unfold it to full length to use on my back (like the picture shows). You have to keep it out of the stream of water, or else the soap will wash right out of it.<br /><br />They were definitely much more harsh than I expected - I can only use them very gently, and can't use them at all on especially thin areas of skin like my shins, the tops of my feet, or my chest. I'd absolutely never use them on my face or neck.<br /><br />After the first use, I noticed an immediate improvement to my bumpy skin. But after I began to scrub with them daily, I felt like it actually exacerbated the problem. Plus, it was just another item to keep in the bathroom and worry about washing every week. As a side note, I wish they made these in white or grey instead of the bright colors - I feel like they'd match so many more peoples' bathroom decor and I wouldn't feel as bad about leaving one lying around the bathroom.<br /><br />Now, I just use a Salux once per week as an exfoliating treatment - they're definitely too strong to be an everyday thing for me, but it does the job and helps with my bumps overall.",True,1,0,1,2

Literally the ears are made of one thin wire that shapes it and it's covered in cheap lace.<br />I could already tell right from out of the packaging that these pair of ears were cheap looking. They did not even make any effort of cutting the lace right. One ear has more lace material than the other and it's kind of bulging out. Plus the lace is already falling apart. There were a few pieces of lace that came off already and I literally just opened the packaging like 10 minutes ago. I had to re shape the ears just to make it look decent, like an actual pair of cat ears and not mouse ears.

It was the third brace I ordered -- the first was not nearly strong enough, and the second sizing was off. I'm so glad I found this one: It's a superb brace -- fine, sturdy stays,plus hinges that let you adjust both flexion and extension. I initially thought that latter feature was something I wouldn't need, but it turns out to have made a huge difference during this first month of healing. (Needless to say, I could not have handled a sleeve-type brace -- the open front/wrap style was mandatory, and made my life so much easier.)  I've been wearing the brace 24/7 -- night as well as day --  for more than a month and it's been my saving grace.  Service has been superb, too: Before I ordered, I measured my thigh, knee and calf; I was on the cusp between sizes, and so ordered up. That seemed like a good idea at the time because it allowed me to wear the brace over my slacks, as well as under -- but after almost a month of continuous wear. the thigh (which was a little larger than I needed to begin with) seemed to have stretched out; I couldn't wrap the upper portion tightly enough and even with the straps cinched tightly, the brace slipped after an hour or two or wear. I wrote the seller and asked if there was a solution -- this brace was costly enough that I didn't want to have to pay out of pocket for a second one -- and they offered to send  me a smaller size. It arrived within a few days, accompanied by a label for free return of the first.  I couldn't have been more impressed or more grateful.

I had to use my nails and grab the seam. Eventually I worked the lid off, but once theres water in it, i couldnt do that again because i had to lay it sideways to do this.<br /><br />Now that I've used it several time the lid comes off easier, but in my opinion, there should have been some kind of lip on the back to hold onto.<br /><br />If you have larger hands, you probably wont have a problem.

I didn't have to buy a new blowdryer! I will admit that I measured the wrong thing when I ordered the SnozzlePro adapter (I measured the base of the concentrator nozzle that came with the blowdryer and not the actual blowdryer nozzle - oops!) My blowdryer is actually a little wider than the measurements given for the SnozzlePro. It was so close, I was determined to make it work! I was able to do it with a little manipulation and a slender tool to give just a little extra stretch to get the SnozzlePro over the end of the blowdryer nozzle (used a tool WITHOUT any sharp edges or points, nothing that could damage the SnozzlePro or the blowdryer). **I did this at my own risk - knowing that I could possibly damage the SnozzlePro or my blowdryer!!** Very gently, I was able to get the SnozzlePro onto my blowdryer. I made sure it was evenly attached all the way around before adding the Xtava Black Orchid diffuser. I attached the diffuser to the SnozzlePro AFTER I put the SnozzlePro on the blowdryer - the opposite of what the instructions advise you to do. (also note that before attaching the SnozzlePro to the blowdryer, I put the diffuser on the SnozzlePro a couple of times to make sure it fit properly and that I would be able to attach it without needing to use the other end of the adapter to make sure it was secure).  After getting everything in place, I'm happy to say that it's very secure and there's nothing that is loose or has any wiggle room whatsoever!! I'm never removing it!! It's there until the dryer kicks the bucket or something breaks! It's working beautifully! It holds very tightly and securely, it hasn't slipped or moved at all since I attached everything!! You can see in the pics how tightly it's holding. I love drying my hair with this diffuser! My hair looks amazing and dries faster than when I used to use a round brush! No more work drying with a round brush! Just using this diffuser and moving it to different sections of my hair, it's easier than ever to dry my hair! Thank you for making this product that allows us to use this wonderful diffuser on other brands of blowdryers!

I’ve never worn false lashes before and was hesitant to use them (obviously since I’ve had them a year without using them - lol!). I’ve seen so many false eyelashes that are so crazy over-the-top obviously fake looking. These are not that way at all. You get a generous supply of them (see photos) and they are reusable too. With the rate I’m going, mine should last forever!<br />I don’t have get up close vision so it was a little bit harder for me to apply them than it would be for someone who can see better. I used a magnifying makeup mirror though and did fine. The photos of the eyelash after it was applied was my first attempt ever to do this so it’s definitely not perfect but it was much easier to apply than I expected it to be. I am sure my results will improve with practice. These are secured in place with magnetic eyeliner (I guess I am pretty ignorant about these things but I had never heard of that!). The eyeliner goes on smoothly; actually better than some liquid eyeliner that I’ve used in the past. It’s a little tricky to get them in the best spot.

I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic! Bring on the shorts and tank tops!",False,1,1,0,2

The salt crystals are very small, and when I tried to vigorously scrub, it washed away before I could properly exfoliate.<br />How I recommend using it, in order to get the best use out of the Himalayan salt is to wet your leg before you step unto the shower, so it's a little more than damp.

Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair.

AFQZ6QZ3TW4JW4ZK57BA62AGY2QQ,B083FMJWT9,3.0,"This was my first experience with a wig that wasn’t from Spirit Halloween and I can’t say it was much better. After trying this wig I decided to learn a little more about wigs and I found a ton of info out there about them and how to do a little work on the less expensive ones to make them look better. (ie: thinning them out, plucking the part and hairline, etc.) I also learned about the features of a wig that make it look more realistic, such as synthetic vs human hair/human hair blend, pre-plucked and lace front. Now that I know a bit about wigs I feel more optimistic that I’ll be able to find ones that are affordable yet look more realistic and/or that I’ll be able to work on them a bit to make them look more so. In summary: The part and thickness on this wig are what I think need the most work. There’s virtually no part and the hair on the top is much too dense and puffy. This could be rectified by plucking but the wig is just not worth the work, IMO. The style of it is cute—The length and the waviness of it were exactly what I was looking for. I can’t say the same about the bangs but that’s the part of the wig that would benefit from some plucking and thinning out. The softness is pretty good for a synthetic wig.  I can’t comment on tangling because I didn’t keep the wig long enough to see how it holds up. The color is hard to comment on because it looks so different depending on the light—It can look like an ashy light brown with subtle highlights, a darker, less ashy light brown with no dimension to it, and in others it appears to have a mauve-like tinge to it. (You can see the differences in the pics.) In the end I returned this wig and after doing more research I decided I wouldn’t buy another inexpensive synthetic hair wig and instead look for a human hair blend that may be a little more expensive but looks more realistic.

I would never put oil or an oil-based product on my skin because it clogs the pores.

I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.<br /><br />What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.<br /><br />I’ll stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.",False,1,1,1,3

AEMSP6DMMT7BGP7RSDQU5GOQQGRA,B00JNI1DZQ,4.0,"My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,<br />the good - I finally found a curler that 'fits' my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool's shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...<br />the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain't nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...<br />the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won't take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky. If you have coordination issues, well - things could get ugly.<br />SUGGESTIONS for use...wash your hands before use. I keep the little plastic clip to keep the tool closed. You could follow the advise of one person here to heat the tool with a dryer, but I think I may skip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time.

Now granted, I cannot use most of the colors as I am super fair-skinned but I am able to use most of the left side of the palette.<br /><br />First, I have terrible dark circles. They are sort of a reddish-brown color. The yellow in this palette conceals them better than any skin-toned concealer I have ever tried. It not only covers but also brightens the area too. I also have a brownish spot on my cheek that bothers me every time I look in the mirror. I have tried everything to cover it. I went to a department store makeup counter hoping they could cover it. The makeup counter girl tried for what seemed like an eternity to no avail. She called her manager over to assess my situation. The manager tried to cover it as well, packing more and more concealer and powder but she also could not cover it. She finally said that it was texture and you cannot cover texture. It sounded like a copout to me. It has no texture, it is just a spot. When I apply the yellow in this kit is does wonders for the spot. It is barely noticeable, almost not at all which is better results than I have gotten in the past.<br /><br />I use the green to cover redness that I have around my cheeks and nose area. I just make sure to blend really well and then put foundation over it to get rid of the green. The purple is used to brighten your complexion. Just like with the green, I blend it well and cover with foundation.<br /><br />The best color that matches my skin tone for concealing is the color directly to the right of the purple. For reference I wear MAC Matchmaster SPF 15 Foundation 1.0. Nine times out of ten I am the lightest shade in any foundation. This color matches and is great at concealing.<br /><br />The darker shades are good for contouring but I prefer to use powder contour rather than cream, just a personal preference.<br /><br />Overall I really like this kit. It does a great job of concealing areas that are a constant bother to me. I am including photos of before and afters of my dark circles and the dark spot on my cheek.

The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the ""good exfoliating"" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the ""ouch, that's scratching me"" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for ""Easy to use"" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.

I wish, however, that it didn't have the olive oil in it, because that's what I think is causing acne in a lot of girls skin. For those with acne or if you just don't want to pay this much, you can get the same ""velvet"" results with rosehip oil. The Ordinary has one for 10 bucks. Rosehip oil can help reduce your inflammatory acne, get rid of acne scars, and clear your skin. Rosehip oil is an anti-inflammatory, able to reduce swelling and fluid buildup. Rosehip oil has a low rating of 1-2 on the comedogenic scale (a.k.a. not likely to clog dem pores). Plus, the linoleic fatty acids in rosehip oil have been shown to reduce oil production in oily skin types which can help prevent future acne. I received this Velvet Skin Drink as a sample & like others, I was impressed, but I found it for brand new & sealed for $24 on Mercari. Personally, because of the olive oil filler and the bottle deception, I wasn't willing to pay $48. They do some great marketing, evidently, as it's out of stock all the time. They make it sound like it's made of purely grapes, which it's not & the bottle deception just isn't worth the hype. Yes, the product is beautiful & makes your skin very soft, but is it softer than my Ordinary Rosehip oil? Nah. This is something nice to splurge on if I find a good deal, because of the of Sarantoni grapes, Resveratrol and lactic acid. But there are no studies on the benefits of these grapes over other grapes & they don't say how much Resvertal and lactic acid they use. I wouldn't consider this an active of any of those products. The Ordinary has both for cheap.",False,1,1,1,3

I really wish they would take a little more care when shipping. Hopefully my next round will go better.<br />**UPDATE**  5/3/21: Got my second shipment today. All in tact! And great color selection!<br />This is my guilty pleasure. It is definitely like gambling. But once every month or so I take the chance and roll the dice.  Some times I get colors I do not have and other times I get 4 of the same. But guess what!?! You can mix these colors and get something that you like.  That is what I do. I have mixed some shimmery colors with solids and came out with a beautiful shade that didn't exist before! And for around $1 each it is such a great deal!!! Dollar store price but top salon quality. This polish has been discontinued which is really sad because it is my favorite by far. It goes on smooth, love the wide brush and consistency. It helps my nails grow and keeps them healthy and protected. Also it lasts forever. I mean the polish in the bottle will last forever. Like no expiration date. I have some that I have had for over 10 years and they still glide like they were new.<br /><br />** This is copy of my review from same product but bought different times and vendors***<br /><br />This a great price for 20 polishes. Buying them in the store would be like $6 or $7. I have to admit this is my favorite guilty pleasure.  It is like gambling lol. For around $1 a polish this is such a fun way to try new colors!<br /><br />I absolutely love this polish. I have used it for years. The nice thing about these polishes is that even after years they still perform as well as the new ones. I love how easy it is to apply. If I am in a hurry, one coat is fine. I like to take my time with my nails so I have steps (below).  I like to change my polish every week so chipping isn’t a problem for me. Also I wear gloves when I do dishes or clean to extend the life of my nails.<br />I love that this polish dries fairly quickly if you don’t put it on too thick. I mean, put on a coat while watching TV or on the PC. Careful not to touch anything! But let it dry thoroughly.<br />Then if you need a little more tint slap a little thin layer to make it pop. Also here are couple tips I learned through my years of doing my nails:<br /><br /> 1. Use the SH Complete Care 7in1 or 170 Clear'd for takeoff as a base coat. (I am pretty sure that is why it’s called that... It makes sense to me) I know they say you don’t need one with this polish, but really it is for easier removal. It makes your life so much easier! Especially with darker colors that seem to get in the creases and under your nail that are a pain to remove.<br /><br />2. Use a white polish (121 let’s snow for example) under any color to make that color really pop. You don’t need a really thick coat of white either. Just enough to give a canvas for the bright color to pop.<br /><br />3. This polish is a little thick so mind that when you apply it. Put one streak down the middle of your nail (your first application to each nail) this will be a little thicker then go to each side and touching the outskirts of the middle line to grab some of the excess there to spread to the sides.<br /><br />4. I use Sally Hansen Salon Manicure Top Coat as well to seal the color in if I am not using a Salon Manicure Glitter Overcoat. I think they both help preserve the color.<br /><br /> 4b. I know glitter can be intimidating because it’s such a pain to get off. Don’t let that deter you. If you like the look of glitter go for it! There are polish removers designed for that now. As well as the polish remover in the jar that you put your finger in to remove color. There is one that has little ridges (or brushes) inside the center wall that help strip the glitter. Can’t tell you where or who. But I can say you probably have one in your town.<br /><br />5. For those of you that like a little shiny nail but not necessarily color. I use the 170 Clear’d for takeoff and add some drops of any sheer color (Arm Candy, Sheer Ecstasy, Sweet Talker, Shell We Dance, Pink Slip) it just looks like a natural nail with clear polish only it hides blemishes! And your nails look super awesome! I get compliments all the time about how healthy my nails look when I do that.<br /><br />I hope these tips help. These are things I have learned over the years. I love doing nails and I am glad to share the things I have discovered to save someone else some frustration or time.",True,1,0,1,2

I was searching Amazon up and down for a heated eye mask that can be worn like a sleeping eye mask to relax my eye muscles after sitting at a computer all day when I finally came across this one. I don't care for the color or the kitty design, but the purple material is velvety soft which I do like.<br /><br />The mask easily covers my head, though I do have a small head, and the strap fits around the back of my head pretty well. I do choose to wear my hair up at night when I use this heating mask otherwise the strap slides up my straight fine hair slowly if I move my head from side to side. And I somehow never wake up with it on, though I'm thinking that has much more to do with me removing it during the middle of the night vs a product error.<br /><br />The power cord is composed of two pieces, the first has one end with a USB and the other as a round female piece. Connected to the mask on the right side is the other piece of the cord. This piece has a male round piece and connects perfectly to the female piece. I imagine this design is intended to allow the cord connected to the mask to easily be pulled out if the person moves during sleep.<br /><br />I plug the cord right into my USB-hub with my phone charger and it works perfectly well.<br /><br />The controls on this are odd, and you are provided zero instructions. There are two buttons I believe one is a (-) that is indented and the other is a (+) that is raised if my memory serves me right. You have to keep one side pressed down until the unit turns on, then I press the indented button because the numbers go up to 60 on this side. The numbers displaced are bizarre and I have no idea what unit of measurement they are - though degrees Celcius makes the most sense.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this product had was sewn in contours for the nose and eye sockets so it was able to lay more flush with your eyes. This would allow your eyes to feel a more direct heat. Usually, to counterbalance this I place one of my arms over the heating mask to apply weight and increase the intensity of the heat.",True,1,0,1,2

I've switched to natural body & laundry products.  However, for some reason, I had been holding out on switching to chemical free cleaning and fabric/air fresheners. I'm not exactly sure why I was so hesitant. These bottles made making the switch fun and easy!<br /><br />These bottles have both a mist and a stream spray option, as well as an option to turn off the spraying mechanism.  Currently, I have one bottle filled with a 1:1 ratio of water to vinegar for use as glass cleaner.  The mist option works well on my mirrors and shower doors.  The mist option also works very well for both my homemade room/linen spray and my pest repellent spray. (Peppermint essential oil diluted with water and sprayed on the baseboards/around door and windows.)  I use the direct stream option for my tub and tile cleaner.  It works very well for spraying directly onto the grout.<br /><br />At 16oz, the bottles are substantial but are not heavy in hand. The trigger is easy to squeeze, yet not flimsy.  The glass itself is a gorgeous, deep cobalt blue.  I keep my homemade air freshener in one of these bottles on the bathroom counter and have been asked multiple times about where I got it.

This product contains lanolin and results in the very best and softest after-shave experience of any soap I’ve tried.  Most premium soaps result in a fair-to-good experience for me.<br /><br />3. VERSATILITY: GOOD. Some soaps seem to shave very well with one brand of blade and not others. Mitchell’s doesn’t seem to mind. I use ASTRA and generally sharp blades.<br /><br />4. LATHER: FAIR. This soap deposits easily onto a wet badger brush, sufficient to lather onto the skin and shave well. It does not whip into a full thick lather if that is important to you. It is also reputed (I have no direct experience) to be difficult to lather at all if you have hard water.<br /><br />5. LATHER DURABILITY: GOOD. The lather on the brush lasts OK during the shave. Easily enough for two passes.<br /><br />6. PUCK DURABILITY: EXCELLENT.  I tend to rotate among several brands of soap, and most milled soaps collect enough water from the brush to decay and dry out somewhat before the puck is finished.

The question is, for how long, considering the flimsy construction of some components and the already below-specified battery life.<br /><br />Things they don't describe in the mostly worthless manual:<br /><br />The charging indicator is a steady red AC plug symbol.<br /><br />The LCD indication at full charge is 99.  A RED (not a far more intuitive GREEN) battery full symbol is shown at when the charge reaches 99.<br /><br />A low battery is indicated by a flashing red AC plug symbol when the charge number on the LCD reaches 10.<br /><br />Charge time was tested and found to be 82 minutes.  The manual claims 60 to 90 minutes, so they got that right.<br /><br />Use time is specified in the manual as 50 to 60 minutes. The run time was tested and found to be only 30 minutes in 5 minute on, five minute off intervals, just free running and not being used to shave which should further reduce the run time slightly.<br /><br />The charge indicator was at 52 after 25 minutes and then rapidly dropped from that to 10 only five minutes later causing the low battery indicator to flash, so I would definitely NOT trust the charge indicator to be an accurate indication of how much shaving time you have left. They are apparently not calculating percent charge remaining and displaying it on the LCD, they are simply and far less usefully displaying percent battery VOLTAGE which drops off rapidly at what is called the battery's discharge ""knee."" A cheap route to take revealing that the LCD display is nothing more useful than a gimmick.<br /><br />The manual states that the razor should be unplugged from the charger (this razor package does not come with an AC to USB charge adapter) when the charge number reaches 99, so I suspect this charger might not have an intelligent charger which stops the battery charge process at full charge to avoid battery damage over the long term. So, I will not put this razor on charge and just forget about it until my next shave like I can with my Norelco with its intelligent charge system.<br /><br />Other information:<br /><br />The space under the heads which catches the beard shavings is very small.

I'm glad I also ordered 53 light beige because I usually end up mixing the two to get it just right. Maybe in the winter this will match better. I also wish there were more shades available, but then ordering over the internet is tough with foundation when you can't compare in person. I apply it with a Real Techniques sponge, and it goes on nice and smoothly. I tried it with a brush, but it kind of looked streaky. Since I also have dry skin, the sponge works better for me anyway. It feels really nice. It feels almost like bare skin but slightly better, like nicely moisturized skin. With a makeup setting spray, I get pretty good coverage for about 8 hours. It might last even longer, but that's as long as I've worn it. Once it seemed to wear off early, but I didn't use setting spray that time either. Also, it's summer and humid here, so I think that makes all makeup wear sooner. I think it would be a great winter time foundation for the extra moisturization and the shade I have is just a shade or two lighter than I need. It is fairly light to medium coverage, but I can build up to good medium coverage. A lot of people comment that it has a fruity smell, and it does but it's not like I pump it into my hand and go 'oh fruit' every time.

In the bottle it looks like an almost exact match to my skin, but when I put it on it’s much paler with a decidedly pink undertone, yet it doesn’t look orange or too pink in my skin. I prefer a neutral undertone though since my skin can be both yellow and pink.<br /><br />I love the bottle and packaging. It comes in a frosted glass bottle with a pink pump and pink cap that snaps on tightly.<br /><br />The coverage is much higher than I expected and it is heavier than expected for a luminous foundation.<br /><br />It covers blue tones better than redness. I have typically had to build it up in areas I have more redness (and we’re talking average redness, not anything extreme) and doing this makes it look much heavier so I end up using a concealer instead. The problem with this lies in the finish.<br /><br />So this foundation’s finish is very confusing and hard to describe. It is very glowy and luminous without being shimmery but it has the heaviness of a matte. I know, confusing.<br />Areas can look too greasy or too dry. It settles into fine lines and creases around the eyes and nostrils. For this reason this is not a foundation I choose for the daytime. It’s much too heavy and shiny for the day, which is a shame because I enjoy it’s longevity. Once I set it with some powder around the eyes and my nostrils I really enjoy it for a night out.<br /><br />I should also mention it is heavily perfumed with a floral scent so those sensitive to scented foundations will likely want to give this a pass. It’s not bothersome to me personally but fragrance can irritate really sensitive skin.<br /><br />All in all I don’t use it as much as I hoped I would and probably won’t repurchase based on that and how heavy it is. At 36 I want a foundation with decent coverage but a lighter feel. It’s also not the easiest foundation to completely remove and when I wear it I have to use a cleaning oil and a cleanser both AND a miceller solution.<br /><br />I have combo skin that can be prone to breakouts with certain brands but I haven’t broken out from this foundation.<br /><br />I enjoy Holika Holika’s BB cream which is why I gave this a shot (and I like a luminous foundation) but I’ll probably stick with the BB cream in the future since it’s lighter.",True,1,1,1,3
AHBA2VLEN2DEPNQDRMV3S2OU6XRA,B014P8G0SS,5.0,"First, I want to say I bought this at full price....period!<br /><br />I've been very lax over years, at any kind of skin care routine.  My skin isn't really showing any effects of bad skin care, because I was blessed with really good skin, but....I'm 52 now and decided I really shouldn't push it any longer.  So; I purchased Tree of Life Beauty Vitamin C wash first.  I was very impressed with the ingredient list, the amount used to wash my face (neck, chest, and shoulders as well), and the way my skin felt afterwards.<br /><br />So when I saw the toner was 93% organic, I decided buy the Tree of life Beauty Toner, to go along with the wash.  First of all, I really am impressed with the ingredients this company uses.  I grow all organics herbs, berries, vegetables, etc. and use as many organic ingredients that I can.  I would love to be a purist, but my budget says &#34;NO!&#34;  This company doesn't use a lot of needless filler ingredients to stretch the product.  So when you think of the product being only 8 oz, you can be assured that 8 oz (when used properly), is a good amount of product that will last.  I can't say how long yet, as I've only been using it a week.<br /><br />Secondly, being an herbalist has taught me that your skin is your largest organ!  You should be careful what you put on it.  Your pores soak up every last drop of whatever you put on your skin.  Parabens are absolute poison and should be avoided like the plague!  (Sorry all of you Vicks and vasaline lovers out there)  From what I've read about Tree of life Beauty, we're on the same page and I don't feel I need to be concerned about them hiding any in their products.<br /><br />And finally, Vitamin C is essential to your body in too many ways to go into.  But I take a vitamin C daily to help with the absorption of Collagen 1&3 (Which is important for hair, skin, nails, bones, joints, etc).  I had not realized the benefits of vitamin C for your face.  I absolutely love the way my skin feels after using the cleanser and toner.  I let it dry well, then follow up with moisturizer both morning and evening.<br /><br />So far, I'm quite happy with Tree of Life Beauty products and will probably transition to more of their products as I use up what I already have.  We'll see how it goes after using these items for 30 days.",True,1,0,1,2
AEX5OAWDSLAVU3RZFASI57DL2RSQ,B017E884HQ,3.0,"The name “Honey Bee Smooth Bath & Body Scrub + Moisturizer” just evokes good thoughts, doesn’t it? If you love honey, it just sounds amazing. I know I love honey and I love using it or having it in my beauty products, so I was looking forward to receiving this product to test it out.<br /><br />There are some actual product packaging concerns that really should be addressed by the company that makes this body scrub. First off, the jar is pretty sturdy, I’m not going to dispute that and it’s amber, which is always good in helping keep out UV rays. The ONLY seal is the Amazon barcode label (One of the photos shows the label, but I cut through it, it was intact when it arrived - so that was not the issue). There was no shrink wrap seal, neither was there an inner seal, nor one of those inner lid liners. This jar also does not have ANY other labeling except for that Amazon barcode and the top label with their website URL. This was a standalone jar, no box. There is no product information on the jar, no ingredient list, no product name, no manufacture or expiration dates. This brings up heavy red flags for me – quality control especially.<br /><br />The product description sounds rather amazing, right? Ok, keep in mind what I previously mentioned about quality control. In their description they advertise that you can EAT it. I’d recommend against it because of the lack of quality sealing. It would be one thing if this were given to me by someone who I knew personally that had made the product, but since this is coming from a company that I don’t know and that doesn’t have anything other than the description on Amazon, I’m not sticking this product in my mouth. I know the anti-bacterial properties of honey, however, that doesn’t mean that it can’t be contaminated by anything else -1) it’s not pure honey, there are other ingredients within, 2) who knows the health/sanitation practices of this company, right?, 3) with there just being the barcode label as a seal, who’s to say that someone couldn’t have tampered with it in the warehouse?, and 4) their only label – the one I mentioned with their website URL – if you go to the URL, it comes up with:<br /><br />“This webpage is not available<br /><br />ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED”<br /><br />I don’t know about you, but without anything reputable to back up the product or company, I find it very hard for me to trust this.<br /><br />ALL of that aside, if you can look past those packaging and trust issues, getting to the actual product…<br /><br />When you open the cover, it does have that very rich strong scent of honey. The brown sugar and other ingredients have settled to the bottom, so some stirring was necessary — the honey is also pretty solid, so a cosmetic spatula (not included) was not adequate enough to stir it.  Once you do stir it, the scent of the brown sugar comes through.  Because it’s honey, it’s really sticky, and like any sugar scrub, it has that gritty sugar texture which is great for exfoliation.  If your skin is dry when you apply, you may have a tough time spreading it, to avoid this, moisten your skin prior to smoothing this along.<br /><br />It does its job at exfoliating, removing a layer of dead skin, but I didn’t expect that it wouldn’t. The product itself is good, leaves the skin smooth and smells good – I used it on my leg.<br /><br />It’s not proprietary though, since there are a ton of DIY tutorials on how to make sugar scrubs out on the web nowadays. But if you’re not into making your own and if they change the packaging and labeling and get a working website up, then this would be the way to go.<br /><br />I really hope that they get the concerns I mentioned in the beginning straightened out. It would have been a decent product all around if not for those issues. If they do, then I'd be more than happy to bump the rating to a 4. This product was given to me complimentary in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",False,1,1,1,3

It does contain enough glycolic acid at a decent ph, it does exfoliate well.  Whatever praises people bestow are germane but only to a certain degree.

This shaver grabbed my hair (still does), gives me razor burn, is made out of a more flimsy plastic, doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as with past models, and is just all around a poor replacement, for, did I mention, TWICE THE MONEY!<br /><br />So I've put up with it for years now and am at the same place again. The heads and battery need replacing for a cost of over $80.00 and I'm sure not going to put that into this shaver. So it's off to the reviews again to find a new shaver. I understand that now that Philips has purchased Norelco that their quality has begun to come back up while their prices have stayed the same or even gone done some. I hope this is true as the alternatives don't exist.<br /><br />In a word, you get what you pay for and with the 6843XL Reflex Plus, you don't get much!",False,1,1,1,3

My skin transitioned into middle age on this foundation, and I didn't realize what a rare thing that is.

AE2WFO6376DYD2DT4HPNT3L2HQSA,B01E6EWCA6,4.0,"I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so.  As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off.  If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too.  The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want.  Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results. I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off.  Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful.  However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.",True,1,1,1,3

I am constantly looking for a cover for my razors - both to keep them clean and to prevent my little ones from coming in contact with the blade. Unfortunately, this design just really falls short. There is a metal plate within the clamp like pod which the blade sits against when the pod is closed. I understand the metal was likely placed there to protect the blade and prevent unnecessary dulling and the build up of gunk. Most razors on the market today have a strip of lotion or emollient along the top of the blade. Unfortunately, the metal from the pod kept fusing to the strip causing both the strip to come off and the plastic of the pod to pull free - resulting in both a broken pod and a damaged and unusable razor. I would also caution this company regarding the name and claim of the product. Although the product is meant to provide a protective cover to the razor -  it by no means provides any sort of sterile environment.... thus I do think calling this a “steripod” might be a bit misleading.",False,1,1,0,2

It was easy enough to attach to the hose but somewhat a pain to take off.  It also only seems to have 2 spray patterns, not 4 like advertised (a hard ""line"" spray and a softer line spray).<br /><br />I was not comfortable spraying my flowers with this because it seemed to spray fairly hard, even when I turned the nozzle to reduce the spray.  So, I started spraying off the mold on my sidewalk.  Our house faces north and is fairly shaded in the front and, since it rains a lot in Florida, tends to get mold build-up on the front sidewalks.

Here's why:<br /><br />After a few weeks of using this cream, I started to develop some sensitivity to it. When I say sensitivity, here's what I mean: 1) The scent bothered me more than it did when I first used the cream. In fact, I started to sneeze most evening after applying it. 2) I'd used the cream on other areas of my face, and noticed minor breakouts in those areas.<br /><br />Basically, I think the cream was just too oily for my skin. Even around the eye area, which has virtually no oil glands, the non-absorbency of the cream left me feeling sticky and greasy even though I gave the cream plenty of time to absorb.<br /><br />End of Edit.<br /><br />***************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Everything else I said in my original review still stands. But the above edit may help you decide if this is the right eye cream for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a natural, plant-based eye cream that is ultra-thick and rich, you'll find it in this 2 oz. jar.<br /><br />The jar will last a VERY long time, because you only need a tiny amount of this cream to cover the undereye area and the corners where crows feet form.<br /><br />I'd advise putting the cream on a couple of hours before bed, since it takes quite a while to absorb into the skin. (If you don't wait, you'll end up depositing most of the cream on your pillowcase.)<br /><br />I've also used a small amount of this cream on other areas of my face (nose to mouth lines) and the results were the same as around my eye area.<br /><br />So what were the results? The skin around my eye area looked smoother and brighter after one night of use.<br />The results on other parts of my face were less noticeable, but I believe continued use of the cream will improve the results in both the eye area and on the face.<br /><br />I'm rating the cream 4 stars instead of 5, because of one major issue I have with it, which is: THE SCENT.<br />The cream has a rather strong minty (?), menthol (?) medicinal smell that takes some time to fade away.<br />Since I prefer NO SCENT in eye/facial products, I deducted one star from my rating.<br /><br />That aside, if scented products don't bother you, and you want a thick, rich eye cream you will probably enjoy using this one.",False,1,1,1,3

It is vaguely floral, definitely a feminine scent. It smells wonderful in the shower, but I like the fact that it fades quickly once you rinse it away. It doesn't linger all day, meaning it won't compete with any other fragrance you are wearing.<br /><br />Second, I like the fact that this set is gentle, and non-drying. (Some other brands have left me with straw-like hair after a few uses.) This combo cleans gently, and leaves the hair feeling silky.<br /><br />Third, the toning is effective. There is a visible difference after just a couple of uses. I saw the yellow/orange tones had faded after the first use, and after the second, my hair was shiny and showed highlights, but there was a marked difference in the amount of brassiness.<br /><br />Fourth, I like the fact that the shampoo is natural (made with botanicals) and is sulfate and paraben free. It is also cruelty free, another big plus. The pump bottles are also great, making the shampoo and conditioner easy to use in the shower. They are plastic, so no breakage issues.<br /><br />Finally, the price is right. The shampoo and conditioner bottles each contain 16.9 fl. oz of product.

In some aspects I founded the Norelco reigning over the Braun and in other aspects the Braun is much better. So, the question you should ask yourself is what type of hair are you trying to shave?<br />Let first look at the Norelco series:<br />The different between the Norelco's Spectra (8000 series), Quadra (7000 series), Advantage (6000 series), and the Reflex (5000 series) is one major feature added to each series. The Reflex sports the basic &quot;Lift &amp; Cut&quot; system. The Advantage is the same but include a lotion dispenser. The Quadra's &quot;Lift and Cut&quot; system has two types of head with a slot and hole. The Spectra series has what the Quadra does, but include a comfort control. Both the Quadra and Spectra don't have lotion dispenser. There are also more special features that can be found in each series by looking at the 2nd digit. For example the Spectra 8894 have a digital screen where the bare-bone lower number Spectra 8825 have just a green light.<br />The performances, Norelco vs. Braun:<br />I have soft hair in the beard area and thicker hair around the lips (mustache and chin area). The Norelco does a superior job in the beard area; it cut it clean with a couple of strokes. When using the Braun (older model 4501), I sometime have to use a long trimmer and then go back over with the coil. The Norelco three individual heads move over the sides of the face a lot better. Braun does do a superior job over the mustache area. It coils has more and bigger holes then Norelco. The Spectra with it dual slot and hole head is good but takes longer time to cut down the thicker stub. The old Braun battery (NH-) is dying on me. Norelco battery (NiCd) is replaceable and you use it charged or just plug and play, which the Braun could not do. Overall, I prefer the Norelco's design.<br />The features I like:<br />I am still playing with the Personal Comfort Control and am not sure if it is necessary. The more sensitive the level is the long it takes to cut so far. The long hair trimmer is great, but that is almost standard in most models, but not the Advantage's Series. Plug and play is great, since I don't travel every day. Cleaning is simple; just rinse it in the sink.

Initially I was excited to find a non-peel nail polish that was water based - I'm allergic to harsh chemicals, so traditional nail polish isn't an option.  I've used Suncoat peelable nail polish before and liked it a lot because it was completely odor free and did not cause any allergic reaction.  It did not last long on my nails, but I figured it was essentially meant for kids, so it's OK it if only lasts for a few hours.  I was only wearing it out for dinner, etc.  Then I've found out that Suncoat also makes water based polish that is non-peel.  I figured I would give it a try.  I've read multiple reviews stating that with proper application the product would last a few days on the nails.  2 or 3 days of wear are more than enough for me as I like to change my colors often.  Also, I understand that water based polish would never be as durable as the traditional polish, so I was perfectly OK to change it out every couple of days.  As soon as the product arrived I applied it as instructed. I did it shortly before bed time so that I wouldn't get my nails wet and allow the polish to cure.

I highly recommend this if you're looking for a clay or mud type of mask to clarify and clear your skin. I suffer from deep cystic acne and broke out earlier this week. I put on this mud mask and I could not believe how great the results were. Within one day my pimples had disappeared and even my damage spots seem to be less noticeable.  My skin felt super soft and clear.<br /><br /> I have a pretty sensitive skin but I didn't have any irritation from this whatsoever. The package says to leave the mask on for 10 or 15 to 20 minutes but I noticed that even after 20 minutes, the mask still was not dried so I did leave it on for longer.  It is a bit of a drying mask so if you already have dry skin, you will want to use a moisturizer following the mask.  I found that when I combined it with my acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, it was just to drying for my skin. Therefore, I would recommend maybe skipping a day of other chemical products when you use this mask.<br /><br /> The mask it goes on really nice and smooth. I used a Q-tip to mix up the mask material as the directions say to stir it each time you're going to use it.  Then I just used the Q-tip to apply the mask and I from layer on my face.  The mask has a cooling a fact and isn't a dry or itchy at all. It was a very pleasant experience overall. It wasn't messy at all to use either.<br /><br /> I posted some pictures below of the material in the jar as well as when it was on my face.  That way, you can see how quickly I put the mask on my face.  I hope the photos are helpful.<br /><br /> Again, I recognize that this is a smaller container than I had previously thought, but you don't need much to cover your entire face. Although I can't say for sure, I am guessing that I would get at least 10 to 15 masks with this product. That is quite a bit considering how much is charged for mud mask facials at spas.  Do you make sure that you see all the container tightly and store it in a cool or dark place as it will dry out quickly if you leave it open.",False,1,1,1,3

AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ,B01HUX250W,5.0,"I LOVE these!!  I have recently gotten into dyeing my hair crazy unicorn colors and I've gotten sick of ruining my really expensive hair clips with all of the permanent dyes.  So I decided to invest in this 6-piece set of clips since I've seen my hair stylist use these when she is separating my hair into different pieces.<br /><br />Anyway, I have really long and thick hair.  So when I'm dyeing my hair, which I do at home, I really need to section the hair pieces off to make sure I get all of the strands saturated with color.  Otherwise, well, I'm not really into striped hair at the moment and uneven dye jobs that LOOK like I did it myself at home after drinking too much wine ;)<br /><br />I got the RED color because I have purple hair and wanted the clips to stand out.  I do not plan to wear these out of the house--they are only for my styling needs at home.  Otherwise, I would recommend getting a darker color because the plastic isn't super nice or stylish looking.  I like that these clips open easily and don't have a super strong grip.  Some of my clips are way too tight and I end up pulling my hair out or getting my hair stuck in the coils.  I like the more flexible feel of these and that they have more give, so I can move them around.  Even though they are flexible, they still hold the hair in place, but just do it less harshly, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I like the set of 6 because I tend to lose track of my clips and so this way, I will have a nice sized supply and won't always be running around my house searching for clips.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I hope you found my review helpful and that I provided enough detailed information so that you can determine whether or not this product is right for you and your lifestyle needs.

I wanted to invest in something that would last a little bit longer even if it was more than the usual dollar store Emery boards I've become so frustrated with. It seems the cheap files I had been buying were constantly had to replace them.<br /><br />The nail files were shipped to me promptly and they are not only extremely functional, but beautiful.

I love them. The set comes with a hard case to store them in. And the 5  files in their cases come in a larger zipped pouch!  they are the perfect size to throw in a purse, keep in my desk at work, stow in the console of my car, and store in my makeup bag while still having one extra in my medicine cabinet at home.  When you consider how much I spend on files for my nails and feet on a monthly basis, and I should never have to replace these --- they come with a lifetime guarantee. That is just crazy to me.

AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ,B01AYTGWA8,3.0,"I'm puzzled by this product.  I loved the idea of having a natural, non-toxic nail polish remover.  I paint my own nails quite often, skipping the nail salon to save money and time.  I've been giving myself manicures and pedicures since 6th grade, so I'm pretty good at it (if I do say so myself) and am well-versed in many of the products out there.  I typically use a 100% acetone remover, which is AWESOME, but I hate that there are so many harmful chemicals, not only on my nails, but also in the fumes I'm breathing in every time I use it.  So, when I saw this product, I was excited and motivated to try it and like it.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was also pleased with the size.  I had assumed it would be pretty small because of the way the dropper looks next to it in the picture, but it's actually a good sized bottle.  Before using any product, I read the directions and particularly with a new type of product like this non-toxic, all-natural nail polish remover.  That's when I saw that you have to leave the product on the nail for 2-5 minutes.  I don't understand this because once you use the dropper to apply the product to the nail polish that's on the nail, it immediately starts dripping down the sides of the nails onto your hands and makes a bit of a mess.  It's also pretty inconvenient to sit there for 5 minutes when I could use my regular nail polish remover and would have clean nails in 30 seconds to a minute.  I decided instead to try pouring the product into a shallow bowl and soaking my nails in it instead.  This did make it much easier and created less of a mess, but it also requires you to use a lot more of the product than you would just using the dropper.<br /><br />I waited 2 minutes and took a cotton ball to swipe the nail to see if the polish would come off.  It started to, but just the top layer.  I re-soaked them in the product for 3 more minutes, and I was able to remove the polish from my nails.  I should also mention that I use Orly bonding base coat, which helps the polish adhere to the nail.  I also had 3 coats of polish, and a top coat, so that might be why the polish was so stubborn to come off.  Plus, it was a deep red, which is difficult to remove no matter what you are using, and it usually dyes my nail beds a bit when I'm removing the polish anyway.  As a positive, I did notice that this product was MUCH less harmful on my nails.  My acetone remover immediately dries out my nails and strips all the healthy oils from the nails and nail beds.  This did not do that.  My nails had a nice, healthy shine to them and the nail beds retained their moisture, which is nice.<br /><br />So, in summary, I love that this product is natural and non-toxic, but it's just not practical for me to spend 5 minutes soaking my nails to wait for the polish to come off.  However, if you are super green and more willing to commit to being patient in order to be able to use something that has no chemicals and is good for your body and those around you (which I commend you for!), then this is a great substitute for chemical nail polish removers.",False,1,1,1,3

Also, if you have layers in your hair it could help blend the hair. I got my own hair thinned out a little at the hair salon and it made a huge difference.<br /><br />This hair will not work well with short hair or thick hair unless you are willing to work hard to blend it.<br /><br />I will be buying one more weft in order to see how that works out for me.

So having a single integrated unit is appealing.<br /><br />However, the implementation is a bit weak. For starters the tank is either glued or heat welded along its entire perimeter and it will, I'm sure, be a weak spot that eventually leaks. As you use it, since it's all one piece, it's really hard to hold on to and the water runs directly down from my mouth on to the unit, making it even more slippery. Maybe the pik head should be angled to allow for the water not to run down on it.<br /><br />If you're someone who travels a lot and you need to have a water flosser with you I think this is worth a try.

AHJFOOXJ35FTKXYWCXZ6GNXG477Q,B0009MFUOA,5.0,"I am very impressed with this razor. I have used electric razors most of my 35+ years of shaving. I was skeptical using it for the first time, I thought it wasn't working because it is so soft to the face and so quiet. It didn't sound ""agressive"" like my other razors did. WRONG!!! The shave was close, my skin was not irritated at all, and it cut smooth basically in the first pass. This unit is first class.<br /><br />My previous razor was a Braun foil. I bought one for myself and another for my son from Frys because of the price. JUNK!!! We both have heavy beards, he more so than I, and both of us had terrible 5 o'clock shadows by 10:00AM! And the skin irritation on my neck, just horrible.<br /><br />I took a long time comparing all the available models. For me this model provides the best mix of features and price. I definitely recommend the Speed-XL shaving heads. Other nice features are it can be cleaned under the faucet, it charges quickly and maintains that charge for a long time, and it provides what I consider one of the best shaves I've had in a long time. The heft and feel is good. Materials are good. Workmanship is good. The only feature I'd like to have is a battery charge indicator.<br /><br />The other Speed-XL model is the 8160. It includes the cleaning system with a much higher price. Now there is the SmartTouch-XL which may be overkill. But if price is not an issue...<br /><br />May, 2012 - I can't believe I wrote the original review almost seven years ago. I'm still using this razor and it still works just as I expressed back then.

But I'm always up for a challenge.<br />First let me say I have fine but thick hair and shoulder length. Normally I use a blow dryer and a circular brush to give myself some volume.<br />This unit comes with 2 brushes, one for shorter hair,one for longer. The brushes have nice soft bristles that won't rip at your hair. So if you do get a tangle it slides right out. I used the shorter brush myself.<br />At first it was difficult for me to use because of a bad shoulder. The size was an issue for me. But with a little practice I got the hang of it. Realizing that it actually takes the place of 2 tools. The blow dryer and circular brush all in one ( still old school I guess 🙃)  And in the long run I found it easier on my bad shoulder because I had to use only one tool instead of two! 💃<br />I also takes some real practice to use the rolling feature. If there was anything I would change, that would be it. There is one for this. And it's very easy to accidentally go the wrong way (😜 believe me not a good look)<br />Once I figured out to just roll it enough to get the hair on and let go of the button, hold it for a moment while the dryer works then pull it through. And WOW it gives you such volume that lasts all day. Leaves your soft and silky too. I'm so impressed!<br />I immediately made the room for this new tool in my bathroom.<br />I would highly recommend it. It's a little intimidating..

I have a couple that I love and work wonderfully--brushes tangled wet hair painlessly, evenly brushes hair to tie it up. I've only tried 4 brands, but this is the worst I've seen. The bristles are weak--they're really thin, even for wet brushes, and they arrived bent (not because it was used--it was in the plastic wrap and everything). I do have thick hair, but this is the first brush I've used (of ANY kind--tiny travel ones included) that feels like it's literally going on top of my hair and not through it at all, even when I try to press down.

The only one this diffuser worked with was the Conair.  Unless you have a BIO IONIC dryer you run the risk that this item will not fit your dryer.<br /><br />When I finally found a dryer that worked with this diffuser, the diffuser worked well.  This diffuser is very well made compared to the diffusers that come with most dryers.  First, it's larger than typical diffusers.  Second, it swivels to open and close the air vents.  I find that it's best used when my hair is nearly dry to put the finishing touches on.  I was a bit skeptical of what a diffuser would offer at this price point, but I think the build quality warrants the price.<br /><br />Overall, I proceed with caution when ordering this product unless you have the BIO IONIC.

AEQJ7JR2SJGHQZIGO72D7RO7OVWA,B000PKKAGO,5.0,"I've been using this razor since it arrived, approximately 2 weeks ago, and thinking long and hard about the score I'd give it.  I actually intended to give it 4/5, the reason being that, while it's an excellent razor, the price point is rather high.  In the end, though, I'm so impressed that I really need to give it a full five stars in spite of the price, with the caveat that you may want to take a look at one of the less expensive, stripped-down models; this one is the flagship, but all the models should be similarly excellent (please bear in mind this is the only one I've used).<br /><br />And excellent it is.  While my feelings have already been summed up in the opening paragraph, read on for similarly styled (but moderate) hyperbole.<br /><br />I've never gotten such a good shave with an electric razor.  Norelco does recommend that you give the razor a full 21 days of your time exclusively (i.e. not shaving with anything else) before making a judgment.  I haven't had the luxury of giving it a full 21 days, as I need to get my review in; however, I've already adjusted to it so well that I can't imagine going back to my old razors.  It will only get better as I get more used to it, although I'm perfectly satisfied at this point and unsure if it could get any better.<br /><br />Not only do I use it to shave my face (which is obviously what it was designed for, and it does a great job), I use it to shave my head.  It's not going to give you as close a shave as a traditional razor, but it's also not going to scrape against your skin like a traditional razor.  You'll also save money on shaving cream (the only extra expense is buying a new razor ""head"" for it yearly, the price of which I am uninformed of).  It works ""dry"".  This is nice for me, as it takes a lot of cream to shave both my face and my scalp, and it does, in fact, do a decent job on my head.  It's a little stubbly, even right after shaving, but honestly the only thing that would do a better job would be a blade, and that's a difficult way to shave (I was previously using a Headblade).  If it can shave a head, where my hair was very thick, I imagine it would be adequate for even the bushiest of beards, and, again, it's designed for faces, not heads.<br /><br />If you look at the features list, you'll see that this model is full of bells and whistles.  Truthfully, they are mostly extras you could live without; the lower-end models would likely be just fine, so I strongly suggest examining them as a money-saving alternative.  The meter that shows you how many minutes of the charge are remaining is sort of handy, the icon that lights to remind you to clean it is somewhat useful, but to say they're necessary would be a grave overstatement.  In fact, the ""wash me"" icon lights up after basically every use, so its necessity is particularly dubious.  (As a side note, it's marvelously easy to clean.)<br /><br />In the end, the product does receive my highest recommendation.  I think if you tried it out, you'd be pleased, and even if you had to send it back and didn't like it after three weeks via their guarantee (it does take time for your skin to adjust), there would be little time/money wasted.  I would, however, encourage you to check out the lower-end models.  Ultimately, even the high price point wasn't enough for me to downgrade to four stars.  I'm normally quite critical.",False,1,0,1,2

The softness is better if you also use the Royal Oils shampoo. When I used a different shampoo, the results weren't as good.

AHE6A2KMCMQSOHCMNE7JQHSAHTRQ,B01ESTMN94,5.0,"This has the very, very *very* faintest plant-like scent (which is clean and pleasing). It's also thicker than I expected - almost like a whipped lotion. Before I used it on my hair, I rubbed some into the back of my hand to see if I'd have any kind of skin reaction. I did not. What I noticed is that once this absorbed, there was absolutely zero residue. I don't know what that means, but I was just curious. When I rub in other types of hair masks & treatments, I always get a sense of something left that I need to wash off. When I used this on my hair in the shower, I left it on for about<br />2 to 3 minutes after I had massaged it in according to the directions. (I have to stop and mention that I was also using the Daelong shampoo and conditioner set beforehand. That might be why I got my results.) This rinses out extremely well. My hair felt conditioned but with a lot less of the residual slip from other conditioners. That kind of worried me. I like to know that a treatment is doing something & the only way to tell until you've used it for a while is by the way your hair feels. Where I became so happy with this is an hour after rinsing it out. I have coarse and &#34;nappy&#34; natural African American hair. My hair tends to be extremely dry - especially after washing. A good conditioner keeps things in check until I can apply my leave-in products (oils, butters, sprays, etc.), but this time, my hair stayed soft and easy to comb through for at least 2 hours. It might have been longer, but I went ahead and applied my usual leave-ins. Still, I know that this did soften my hair (the day after, my hair is retaining softness without any more leave-in applications) without making it feel fragile. With they type of hair I have, I have to worry about breakage. I realize that I have probably been clogging up my scalp by over-doing it with the oils and butters. I like that I haven't had to use more of them for my hair to feel manageable. As a test, I'm going to try easing up on using so much leave-in stuff while I continue to use this.I think these guys are on to something here. I will have to come back and update this review as I use this for a while but, for now, I love the way this makes my hair feel, even after just one treatment. Normally, I only fully wash my hair once every four weeks or so. I will do a co-wash about every other week to keep it clean without stripping it. While I am testing this out, I plan to use it at least once a week as my co-wash. Like I said, I am also using the shampoo & conditioner of this brand. That might be a big part of why this worked so well for me, but I think that this would work just as good on its own. By the way, I'm going to alter my washing regimen for a while to use the shampoo and conditioner at least every other week. I almost forgot to mention the other thing I was concerned about: the label says that this makes the hair &#34;straight and silky&#34; - which is exactly what I, personally, DO NOT want. I love my texture and want to keep it. My texture is the kind that is prone to slow growth (because of breakage) so... I'm not worried about losing my naps.

If other customers do want this one, I can tell you that it works, the shape is nice and makes it easy to grip and use with either hand. It's also nice that their is a coarse side and a finer side. One thing that I disagree with is that you could use this anywhere but on your feet. I don't know what would have to be going on with anyone's elbows or knees for them to use this on!

With that said, each one of these devices is using it's own charger and because of that, I had to resort using a power strip by my bedside JUST to charge all my devices.<br /><br />The current chargers I use are all stock (1 Apple Charger, 3 Samsung Chargers).  One of the Samsung Chargers is directly from the S6 Edge Plus (supports Adaptive Fast Charging/Quick Charge 2.0), yet it fails to work 80% of the time on my S6 Edge Plus for whatever reason...<br /><br />Another issue is when I go away for overnight trips somewhere.  For a day, I could probably just get by with just the iPhone charger & Samsung charger, but when I have 3-4 night stays due to work, I have to pack all of them!!!  It's just a big hassle.  That's when I decided I'm just going to resort to buying a GOOD multi-port charger.  I've used Ankur devices in the past and I've been very pleased with all of them.  After reading various reviews, I decided the 3-port is perfect for my situation.<br /><br />For $25, you get a 3-port charger: 2 PowerIQ ports and 1 Quick Charge 2.0 port (which the Edge+ takes advantage of).<br /><br />I've used the Ankur PowerIQ tech before via an Ankur Car Charger and I can definitely say it's almost as good as the Quick Charge 2.0 technology.  What I like about it is that it supposedly &#34;detects&#34; what kind of device is connected to it and charges accordingly.  Whether this is true or snake oil, I can say that it charges my devices fast and never has any kind of power dip when you have multiple devices connected to it.  I use these two ports for my iPhone, Galaxy Tab4 and New Trent Battery pack.<br /><br />The single Quick Charge is dedicated to my Galaxy S6 phone and right out of the box (same cables and all), it would fast charge my phone 100% of the time.  Unlike my old stock Quick Charge Charger, it never seemed to work.  So when I'm charging my phone and seeing it will fully charge within an hour makes me happy!<br /><br />The only initial turnoff is the $25 sticker price.

At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron.

AHF57VHYENVKYRF2B66VJSRPJ6RQ,B00XBRCWSM,5.0,"This acrylic makeup organizer by MelodySusie is part of my ongoing effort to get myself more organized. Until recently my makeup was an absolutely disaster. I finally got sick of that and decided something needed to be done, so after gathering everything up (and culling a huge amount that I just do not use any more) I started sorting and putting things into this organizer. With several drawers and compartments it was easy to arrange everything in a compact space so I could still see everything. I also really liked the flexibility that this organizer offers. I currently have the dividers in place in the bottom drawer since I am using it to keep my most often worn pairs of earrings easily accessible, but if I were to ever get more makeup I could remove the dividers and use the drawer as it, and setthe divider on the counter on its own to hold additional items.<br /><br />The organizer itself seems to be well made - nice and sturdy with parts that fit together well and are well finished so there are no rough jagged edges. The included drawer liners are a nice touch and they help to keep things from rolling or rattling around each time I open and close a drawer. I like that the top section is a separate unit that can be removed as this makes cleaning much easier. I wear powdered foundation (that famous brand that you swirl and tap) and particles of it seem to get into everything. With a removable top tray, when it needs a deep cleaning I can just remove all my makeup from it and rinse it under the faucet without messing up the items that are in the drawers. That's not possible to do with an all in one unit where the top tray is attached to the base drawers.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy wih this organizer. It works very well for my makeup, though I can also see it working well for other uses. As an artist I can see it working very well in my studio to organize art supplies as well.<br /><br />I did receive this item at no cost for the purposes of testing and review.

AFQPAHUB5L25MYFQ4KEIKBYDNP3A,B00XASW2VO,4.0,"This is an interesting way to market a Konjac Sponge, i.e. for your pets. I have to say though, it's pretty brilliant. I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well.

AFZAXGTEJHTDFZSZB6CRZ4QDBKGQ,B0108V1QFI,5.0,"UPDATE - 09/30/16 ========================================<br />Still loving this moisturizer and just ordered another package. This stuff goes on well, absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling! My skin feels truly moisturized. I love using it on my hands and feet before bedtime, this way it really absorbs into my skin overnight.<br />Love it, love it, love it!<br /><br />========================================================<br />Not many people know this, or give it another thought sometimes - anything you put on your skin gets absorbed through the skin and ends up in the blood stream. This is why I am rather careful when picking my skin care products. I have been staying away from most hand creams for a while now just because for the most part there's at least a few potential carcinogens lurking among the ingredients.  Even though the big famous brand creams make your skin feel wonderful the question is if the trade off is worth it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even so called organic products aren't always that safe. Provided, manufacturers of this goodness are disclosing all the ingredients on the label (and not hiding anything) this cream looks safe enough to eat. Therefore, I have been happily slathering it all over my hands (and any other body parts needing additional moisture) in the past few weeks and I am quite pleased with the results.<br /><br />This white fluffy goodness feels surprisingly light and absorbs quickly into the skin. I must admit, it is a tad thinner in texture than I had expected but on the other hand this lightness ensures there's no oily residue left on your hands. The cream has no scent whatsoever which is a definite positive for those who are sensitive or don't particularly appreciate scented products. I'm adding a drop of essential oil of my choice (whatever I feel like that day) when I apply the cream if I feel like smelling something nice. Basically this cream is your blank canvas and leaves much room for creativity.<br /><br />One thing I would probably change about this product is the packaging. (At least maybe as an option for buyers to choose from) I really think that tubes are better for hand creams - way easier to dispense and so much more hygienic (sticking your fingers into the container doesn't really help keep it germ free).

I have seen dermatologist and tried a lot of things but they often dry out my skin too much, causing my skin to produce MORE sebum (oil) combining with the  medicines side effect of dry dead skin sells. This is a fast way to disaster skin-wise and often causes my skin to worsen. Because of this, I have tried many different facial cleansing devices, and here are the points that I like about this one.<br /><br />1) Rechargable! Nothing is worse than needing to use a facial scrubber only to find that the batteries are dead. I cannot tell you how many times that the batteries have died (in other models) and then to make it worse, I often discover a mess of rust when I open up the compartment to change the batteries. The fact that this unit can be easily charged through a micro USB is not only convenient but also costs less and is safer.<br /><br />2) Variety- all the different attachments that come with this unit is a nice little bonus. I can't genuinely say that I would use all of them (remember, trained in skin Haha) but as a consumer I still appreciate the additional options.<br /><br />3) Quality- at this price point, it's surprisingly well made. I was a little concerned with the rubber cap that protects the USB port, but other than that, it's sturdy. The plastic does not flex at all, and it feels solid.<br /><br />4) Sound- I never thought that something like sound would bother me, but I definitely noticed how quiet this unit is compared to other models I've owned. I have two small children, so I'd often have to go to a bathroom further away from their bedrooms to cleanse my face at night, but with the noise level of this cleaner, i'm just genuinely not concerned with waking them.<br /><br />The only 'con' that I've found personally is the speed of rotation vs the softness of the bristles. I feel like it would be more productive to either have the head rotate faster or have harder bristles. Having said that, skin is very thin, especially when it's sensitive like mine. I DO prefer the softer bristles, because they are much kinder to my skin and I don't have to worry about causing more damage to inflamed areas. However, the brush's rotation was just too slow for me, (please see my review video for a short view of the rotation)  and I felt impatient at how long it took to get a thorough round of cleansing and sloughing to my face. Because of this, I cannot rate at 5 stars because it's just simply not as good as it could be. But, all things considered it's still a good sturdy competitor at its price point in today's market.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review. I strive to provide fellow consumers with the most detailed, unbiased and (hopefully) helpful reviews that I can, believing that allowing a discount to influence a review is a disservice to other shoppers.

I have been using this tool once per day at night for 7 days (I missed 1 day out of the 7 days) in combination with my normal nightly face routine. Prior to using the face tool, I apply a liberal amount of my eye cream so that there is still some that is not completely rubbed into my skin (the instructions recommend using an eye gel or similar product). I then use the wider, blunted tip on the tool and slowly move the tip around my face and pause in each area for about 5-10 seconds per the instruction manual.<br /><br />The tool itself is about 6.5&quot; long and feels like a wide marker when held in your hand. It is powered by 1 AAA battery (not included) and has a power button with 2 intensity levels. When turned on, the tool emits bionic waves via the tool's tip when it makes contact with your skin (see demonstration in video). The lower wave intensity is supposed to be used for slight to moderate wrinkle reduction and the higher intensity is meant for deeper wrinkles. However, during my testing, I used the higher intensity level exclusively (all of my wrinkles looked deep to me lol). The instructions state that the tool can be used up to twice per day (with at least 6hrs between each treatment time) and should be used on clean skin. Treatments do not cause any pain/discomfort and do not leave any marks or redness on your face.<br /><br />This wrinkle eraser is incredibly easy to use, though does take some time dedication if you follow the recommended 5-10sec per skin surface area. I have already begun to see results (thanks to remembering to take &quot;before&quot; pictures) and will 110% continue to use this tool indefinitely. Now that I know the tool works, I'm going to start using the smaller tip on the wrinkles just under my lash lines in addition to using the broader tip around my eyes. I am looking forward to seeing more results, and I would highly recommend this product to others.<br /><br />*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ,B014SRAOVK,5.0,"I LOVE these bun makers!! I have an old bun maker that I've been using for years, but that one just got tossed in the trash because these new ones are SO much easier to use and the finished product looks much better!! These bun makers are unique in that they are foam, which helps to grip your hair to better hold it in place. They also have a very strong inner wire that holds them in place in a perfect circle. I have relatively long (just past my bust line) hair with long layers - the trick to getting all of the end pieces of the layers to stay tucked in place is to pull the bun maker down the length of your ponytail just before you reach the end of the shortest layer. Then, fold all of the rest of the ends upward over the hair piece and tuck them inward towards the center of the ponytail. As you roll the hair piece upwards, continue to tuck any loose ends in so that they are held in place by the rolled hair. The other trick to getting a perfectly round bun is that once you have rolled the hair piece all the way up with your hair, fold the ends inward towards each other to form a circle, but make sure to tighten this circle as much as possible by pushing the ends as close together as you can. Otherwise, these hair pieces are fairly self-explanatory to use, and there are step-by-step instructions included with each of the four bun maker pieces. In addition to these four pieces, this product also includes 2 sets of 8 bobby pins -- 1 set is about 2&quot; long each and the other set is about 3&quot; long.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.",False,1,1,1,3

I do suffer, however, from severe seasonal allergies and am constantly plagued with dark circles (&#34;allergic shiners&#34; as they call them) and extreme puffiness of both my upper eyelids and just under my eyes (the infamous &#34;bags&#34;).<br /><br />To be honest, my impression of this cream at first glance wasn't too great. For starters, the jar of cream was much smaller than I had imagined, but I guess that's my fault for not noticing the (very) small-printed &#34;0.5 fl oz&#34; on the label in the picture. (I do think that this was a little deceitful though, because the size/amount of this cream is not listed anywhere on the product description.) In addition, while trying to read the teeny tiny print on the jar, I also almost immediately noticed a spelling typo on the front of the label that reads &#34;Nautral & Healthy&#34; rather than &#34;Natural & Healthy.&#34; I know this seems like a rather minuscule and knit-picky detail to point out, but it did make me at least wonder about this company's quality control standards.<br /><br />Despite my initial impression, I gave the company/cream the benefit of the doubt and have been using it for the last few days. With my first application under my eyes, the cream felt more on the &#34;thin&#34; side (similar to a lotion rather than thick cream), but while rubbing the cream into my skin in a circular motion, the moisture that the cream delivered was far better than I anticipated. It takes at least 3-4 minutes before your skin feels like the cream is completely absorbed, which gave me ample time to slowly massage the area during absorption (and felt very soothing and relaxing). I had absolutely no issues with any side effects or skin reactions such as burning, tingling, redness, or irritation. I noticed a small &#34;immediate&#34; reduction in the pores and fine lines of the areas I applied the cream, though not as impressive as some of the Retinol and Vitamin C serums that I've used in the past. There was no obvious difference in the dark circles or puffiness right after application, however, within about 30-45min, the puffiness started to visibly decrease and the area all around my eyes felt less tender/achy in general.<br /><br />With each subsequent application, I noticed the same resulting decrease in puffiness as was observed initially. My puffiness did return each morning, but I expected because I'm still constantly being exposed to my allergens. (After all, the cream is meant to relieve a symptom of my allergies, not be a miracle cure for my chronic systemic condition.) I've noticed that if I apply the cream immediately before bed and spend more time rubbing it into my skin in the circular motions, I do have a noticeable decrease in the morning when I wake up compared to before I started using the cream. As far as the under-eye dark circles, I can't tell a difference so far - but in all fairness, I've only been using the cream for 4 days (twice daily) so there's still hope.<br /><br />Now for the best part (in my opinion, at least). On the second night of using this cream, I had yet another one of my throbbing headaches (allergies are the worst!!) About 15-20min after my evening cream application, I noticed that my headache felt a little better -- I'm not saying that there was some miraculous change here, but it did feel less severe. This was very unusual for me, as I hadn't taken any ibuprofen or Zyrtec at that point (my usual go-to medications when my headaches are severe). The only thing I could think that I had done differently this time than any other time was that I applied the cream -- it was a strange connection, but stranger things have certainly happened to me. I went back to look at the ingredients listed on the jar and saw that it had rooibos in it. I had absolutely no idea what this was (and probably didn't notice it the first time I looked because I don't have a magnifying glass), but I looked it up online and read that it's an herb from South Africa with a laundry-list of health benefits -- including antioxidant properties and... headache relief?!?! Although still relatively skeptical that this was just a coincidence and that I had gotten &#34;lucky&#34; on my google search, I was still optimistic and proceeded to rub the eye cream on my temples and at the base of my skull to see what would happen. After a good 30-45min, my headache was almost completely gone. I know this headache thing sounds ridiculous and obscure, but I encourage anyone to research this mysterious Rooibos for themselves. I haven't had a headache as severe as that one since, but I have had a few headaches start to come on, and with each headache, I applied the cream to my temples, under my eyes, and to the base of my skull and the feeling has gone away each time within about an hour.<br /><br />With all of this said, I couldn't rate this &#34;eye&#34; cream turned headache remedy anything less than 5 stars despite my initial less-than-thrilled first impression. Because the cream is light and only requires a very small amount with each application, I think the small jar will actually last me a reasonably long time, too. Between the headache relief and the disappearing eye bags, I would be confident in recommending this product to others. I was also fortunate to receive my first jar of this cream at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",False,1,1,1,3
AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ,B00A0RUGPM,4.0,"I ordered this silicone pad to place on my vanity so that I could rest my curling/straightening irons on it while getting ready without having to worry about scorching the wood vanity top. Overall, it works well and it just small enough to squeeze between the two drawers that come up on either side of my vanity. I have a love/hate feeling for the little raised &#34;dots&#34; that cover each side of the mat. I like them because they raise the hot tool when resting on the mat to give extra heat protection to my vanity top underneath it. However, I also put my makeup on at my vanity and because of the silicone surface, every little drop of makeup powder is attracted to and clings to the silicone mat surface. The silicone isn't that difficult to clean (I use either pledge spray or a lysol wipe), but the little raised dots make it difficult to get into all the little grooves in order to get the mat perfectly clean. I could move the mat while I put my makeup on, but I don't have many places to put it on where I get ready, so this would be a huge inconvenience. Plus, regardless of where i put the mat, it will still collect dust overtime and have the same cleaning issue.<br />As a solution to cleaning the mat, I started running it under warm water and using a dish brush with bristles to scrub the mat and get in those difficult grooves, which has been successful as far as perfectly cleaning the mat - it's just a little more tedious than I'd like it to be.",True,1,1,1,3

So what do I do I order it anyways because hey I love the earth, but I want to be pretty too. I've had this stuff for like a week already and even though my toes look like they have been through war I still just keep staring at it. Well today I finally decide to take the plunge. I read all of the instructions and see that you have to let it &#34;sit&#34; on your nails for 2-5 minutes. It's very difficult for me to stay still that long, so I figure I'll try it out and see what happens. Mind you I am not trying this on any regular nail polish, no. I have the polish from my last pedicure which is a light pink glitter polish AKA the worst type of polish to try to remove. I feel like I'm setting this stuff up to fail, right. So I grab the dropper and fill it up. I place a few drops on each toe (for those of you keeping track this is a watery formula and will not stay well if you move at all). I did keep moving about my business for 5-6 minutes. I then return with some cotton pads. I wipe the big toe not expecting much and almost the entire polish wipes away in one swipe. I kid you not more than 3/4 of the polish was gone in one swipe. I'm in disbelief at this point, so I stare and pick at it like it's going to talk to me. After a few minutes in awe I finish the rest of my toes. I did have to go back and do it one more time because my toes are very curved and like I said I cannot sit still, however it didn't bother me at all. This stuff removed disgusting glitter polish in less time and less smell than any other product I've ever used. I am so impressed that I keep staring at the pad I used to remove the polish. It's like it just melted it into a sheet and it just slides off of my nail. It's really cool. I am impressed also that I do not need a ton of this stuff to remove all the polish for my toes so I'm thinking it will last a while. I will re-order this stuff once mine runs out.

They are pretty easy to use too! The instructions are on the back of the box and they even have pictures for you to follow. To heat up the wax strips all you have to do is use your hands and rub them and the heat from your body allows the wax to warm up enough for you to pull the paper apart. You simply stick the wax strips on the area that you want the hair removal. It didn't really say how long you should leave it on before removing it but I feel like it needs to cool a bit to get a bit harder before you pull it off. One of my issues is that I didn't feel like it pulled off all the hair that I wanted to be gone within that area that I put the strip. If I am going to go through some pain for this hair removal I don't want to have to do it multiple times on the same area of skin. To finish up you are supposed to open the post cleaning wipes, however they left my skin oily and feeling kind of greasy and I didn't like those.

Comes with a silvery tone putty type substance in a little container all you have to do is put your hands in kind of rub it around your hands and then run it through your hair. It was really the easy to do on someone else but takes a little bit more time to do on yourself though if you get some on your skin or ears or wherever you can just take a wet damp towel or a white or something like that and wipe it right off. In the picture that shows you doing it too long hair but I tried it on my long hair and absolutely did not work I could not pull a comb through it and it was hard and strange and it definitely works better on men's hair that is short. When it was dry it got kind of hard like a gel or something like that. It's really easy to make it look nice you just have to continue working it through the hair until you get the desired color and style that you want. We tried it on a beard as well and it didn't look as good on the beard it kind of looked better on the medium to short hair but not super super short like a beard. We even used it and my boyfriend's hair who is African-American and it came out pretty cool. Kind of makes you look like you have silver gray hair. It was really easy to wash out renting it out just with water gets a lot of it off but a little bit of shampoo get it out in just a second. I don't recommend going to bed with this in your hair as it will leave silver glimmery stuff on your pillowcase to make sure you wash before going to sleep or laying down on anything.,True,1,1,1,3

Still, the darker ""roots"" of the piece are almost perfectly matched to mine, so I think I can pass it off as real.  I have very fine hair, and I do NOT like thick hair pieces. That's another hard thing to find,....hair pieces that aren't unrealistically thick and ""weighty""!  This piece is full, but not TOO full, not so thick that it looks fakey or heavy.  The ""messy"" feature is definitely very messy, the hair is completely straight and a bit spiky looking, yet very soft to the touch.  The center opening is too big, the elastic to loose for me to wear it over my own ponytail or bun without additional fasteners.  I use a couple hidden bobby pins at the top of the piece to secure it to my own hair.  It's easy to do and unnoticeable but can sometimes get a little heavy and ""pulling"" if worn for hours.

I have tried several things from the Baebody line of products, and they have all been very high quality and very effective. I am a huge fan of Retinol and how it benefits the skin. I am at a crappy age where I still get breakouts, and I am starting to get wrinkles. I hate having the same gross skin as I did as a teenager. And I have tried everything! Prescription meds, prescription creams, ProActiv, micro-dermabrasion, chemical peels, etc,etc. Nothing seemed to help until I started using this Retinol Serum. Retinol is just a fancy word for Vitamin A and apparently me skin is in desperate need of it. It acts on DNA to promote healthy epidermal skin cells. It does a great job of moisturizing my skin, which helps with wrinkles. And it also does a great job of preventing breakouts. If I do break out because of hormones, it helps clear them up without drying out my skin. Sometimes it clears up my skin within a day or overnight. Vitamin A is a really potent antioxidant that protects your skin from free radicals, generates cell growth, and repairs damaged cells. Retinol belongs to a family called retinoids, and is one of the only substances that is small enough to penetrate the outer epidermal layer to the layer where collagen and elastin reside. It is really strong at first. It is really effective and it is tempting to want to use too much too often, but it can end up irritating the skin. I started using it every other day at first and then built up to using it every day. I also like to use a Vitamin C serum, but using Vitamin C and Retinol together tends to decrease their effectiveness. And sunlight decreased the effectiveness of Retinol, so I use the Vitaming C serum in the morning and the Retinol Serum at night. I let it work it's magic while I sleep.

But I was in the search for a more affordable toner/emulsion/serum and was excited when they introduced this line and gave a discount.

Contrary to their marketing claim, there is no such thing as beta hyaluronic acid.  Yes I looked up patent registry and trademark registry and Amorepacific didn’t register anything new in the past few years related to hyaluronic acid. They just put a new spin on beta glucan, which according to some studies works 20% better, not 150% like they claim.

AEAJBHE5KH74FQG2U4WJVGACT7PA,B00NT0AR7E,3.0,"ANOTHER UPDATE:<br /><br />My dermatologist told me that unless a Vitamin C serum contained the L-ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C, I was wasting my money and doing little to improve my skin.  I found a serum here on Amazon that contains 17% L-ascorbic acid, and I've been using it for approx. 3 weeks.  What a difference!  I can definitely feel it working for one thing (it burns for about 5 seconds), but more importantly, I can SEE the difference in my skin already.  At first I thought my eyesight was going downhill, but then I realized my skin really did look smoother and had a new glow.  Do an Amazon search for L-ascorbic Vitamin C serum to get the good stuff.<br /><br />Having said all this, I have added a LOT more spinach to my daily regimen lately, so I'm sure that's contributing to my skin's appearance too.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finished the bottle which gave me about 5 weeks of use.  If it made any difference in my skin, it's at a microscopic level.  I'm buying another bottle - mainly because there's got to be SOME truth to all the 5-star reviews.  But if, after another month or so of use, I still don't see improvement in my skin, I'm asking a dermatologist for a Rx for Retin-A.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I've been using this product for three weeks, and I have yet to see any improvement in my skin.  I'm amazed (and not a little skeptical) about some people seeing results in two weeks.  I also wonder how many 5-star reviews were written by people who were given the product to try.<br /><br />I'm very methodical about using new products on my skin.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror, establish a &#34;baseline&#34; area of my skin to observe over time, and take close-up &#34;selfies&#34; of my skin to compare with photos taken a few weeks later.  No difference so far, but I'll continue to use this product until it's gone.<br /><br />I DO like that this retinol doesn't irritate my skin, which is highly unusual.  So unusual, it makes me wonder if it indeed contains any retinol.<br /><br />In conclusion, and not a critique of the product itself, but the product won't dispense through the pump.  It's too thick.  I'm having to pull the cap off and shake the serum on to my fingertips. I wish it came with a dropper instead.  I changed out out the pump with a dropper from another bottle of serum.  I'm surprised I haven't read about this problem in other reviews. Another reason I'm leery of all the glowing comments.<br /><br />I'll update with my progress, or lack thereof, at a later date.",True,1,1,1,3

AGJNM4JNLYNTT6N7VPOXUWM2PB4A,B0009MFUOA,5.0,"Summary: Nothing not to like!<br /><br />Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the ""Speed-XL"" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br /><br />Why this razer is good:<br />The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br /><br />Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br />The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br />The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br />Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br /><br />That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br />This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br /><br />All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.",True,1,0,1,2

The only thing I definitely don’t use it for is my home-made cleaning products where citrus oils are the only essential oils.<br /><br />This particular oil is a very delicate scent – some lavender oils can pack quite a punch in terms of the scent. This is certainly floral and has a ‘high note’ to it. You can easily pick it out of a blend. It’s my first oil from New York Biology and I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I love blending lavender in particular with chamomile, as it has an almost instantaneous calming effect. Also love to blend it with bergamot, ylang ylang, mandarin, and a drop of lime.<br /><br />The bottle is very large, a dark brown color to protect the oil from UV rays which can damage the oils and decrease the shelf life.

Very specific and she didn’t want anything that did not have at least those two ingredients.<br /><br />The reason is a conversation with her dermatologist. Matrixxyl is made of 2 peptides, palmitoyl-tripeptide and palmitoyl-oligopeptide, which stimulate collagen and elastin production in the skin. And peptides form a long chain of amino acids to become proteins, penetrating the top layer of skin cells and signaling the cells including collagen.<br /><br />The Cazbe serum works really nicely in tandem with my mom’s Ponds cream (she has used Ponds as long as I remember). The serum absorbs pretty rapidly and unlike other serums, doesn’t seem to leave her skin feeling sort of ‘tight’ or dry. After a few minutes (she will put the serum on before brushing her teeth, and then follow with moisturizer after teeth), she will apply the Ponds cream to completely moisturize her face.

If used just around my eyes, it feels a lot better.<br /><br />Her skin is looking beautiful.

I am also pleased with the retinol cream. Having very sensitive skin, I tend to use products containing retinol quite sparingly (aka, every few days, vs. daily) as they tend to cause my skin to become quite irritated or scaly after a few days of daily use. I’ve been using this around just my eyes every evening (about 1 hour after applying a hyaluronic acid serum), as my skin is so sensitive that using anything with retinol on my entire face seems to really cause a lot of scaliness. And, this is where the fine lines are really beginning to show.<br /><br />The results – after using a cream with retinol in combination with hyaluronic acid serum for 3 weeks, I’ve been noticing a definite reduction in the fine lines. They are still there but they were becoming really noticeable.<br /><br />The cream has ingredients that are highly moisturizing (again, which I like to follow up on a serum with). The consistency is pretty thin (not thick and creamy like a lotion), and there is no noticeable fragrance. It seems to absorb quickly and is not oily.<br /><br />Some note on the ingredients:<br /><br />Retinol 2.5% - Retinol is another name for Vitamin A, which is an antioxidant (helps reverse the damage caused by free radicals, apparent in wrinkles and aging), encourages the production of collagen, and elastin.<br />Jojoba Oil - closely resembles sebum (a waxy substance produced by our skin glands), packed with vitamins and minerals - Vitamin E, B, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine and chromium.<br />Green Tea - Tea is high in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, whether ingested or applied topically. Green tea contains tannins which can reduce puffiness and inflammation of the skin. It also contains polyphenols, which can combat free radicals (which contribute to aging). The catechins in tea can combat the bacteria that contribute to acne.<br />Propolis - Propolis, “bee glue or bee penicillin” is the resinous material gathered by honeybees from flowers and leaf buds of various plants. It contains dozens of anti-oxidants,<br />Shea Butter - The moisturizers in shea butter are similar to those produced by the skin’s sebaceous glands, making it one of the best choices for super-dry or cracked skin. Shea butter also contains anti-inflammatory compounds – great for applying to inflamed or irritated skin (think eczema, chapped skin, bug bites)<br />Vitamin B5 - A humectant (a water-binding substance that attracts and retains water). Particularly good for the skin as it stabilizes the skin barrier, increasing hydration and improving softness and elasticity.<br />Vitamin E - A powerful antioxidant, that neutralizes the oxidant effect of free radicals, which are molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles<br /><br />*I received the retinol cream for evaluation and review",False,1,1,1,3

Now I'm sitting here typing this review with an incredibly thin layer of wax all way down my still very hairy left leg.<br /><br />I purchased the wax roughly 3 months ago, so I don't think the wax is expired, and it was stored in the original packaging in the meantime. I think the main issue is with the roller unit in general. I was literally pulling more hairs out just rolling the wax onto my leg than I was will the couple of strips I did manage to try. I don't have an issue with pulling hairs or anything. Tweezing nose hairs, or threading is WAY more painful and I don't have an issue with either of those.<br /><br />It took the unit forever to just warm up enough, instructions are laughable at best (broken unclear English), the included wax cleanup wipes are useless & dry (I'm about to google how to remove all this excess wax off my leg in a moment here). I feel if I could break open the unit and heat the wax over the stove it would work 100% better, but I don't want to risk my cookware.<br /><br />Update: #1: I was able to successfully microwave the cartridge for 3 mins in a bowl of water. 5 minutes would likely work better for you as my cartridge was still warm when I started. The wax rolled much nicer this time around, but still required some pulling, however it started to pool on one side of the roller resulting in the whole roller stopping again and even got a spot onto my bathroom rug that I had been carefully avoiding... The irritation from the wax is worse than using a depilatory cream (such as Nair)<br /><br />Update #2: After oven an hour of attempting to remove the wax with various products. (baby oil, oil-free makeup remover, acetone, rubbing alcohol, body wash, and finally olive oil in that order). The olive oil and now trashed white washcloth finally did the trick.

It comes with the massager, pop-out attachment for the cleansing pad,(14) and a AA battery along with 14 cleansing pads. First, let me say I'm in my fifty's so skincare is important to me but I don't have the luxury of spending hundreds on skincare products. My skin is now starting to show signs of aging by fine lines and deep wrinkles and circles under my eyes. My main goal from this product is for my skin to improve in the following areas:<br /><br />more even skin texture<br />more radiance<br />more firmness<br />more softer, subtle feel<br />help with deep skin cleansing and exfoliation<br /><br />  I used this product today for the first time following the instructions carefully. The product is very well made so far as the size as it comfortably fits in your palm. The attachment which holds the cleanser pad comes of easily and the cleansing pad attachs to it with no problems. Simply wet the pad with some water and push the button to start.You can also re- wet the pad if more is needed later. The vibration is both somewhat quiet but not irritating on the skin at all. You don't need to push on the product while holding it as it does the massaging for you!! The cleansing pads have a nice smell to them- nothing too perfumy, just a nice clean smell. Simply guide the skin massager over your face concentrating on the areas that you feel need the most attention. You control how long you feel each area needs to be cleansed.<br />  I found my skin afterward to be more soft and brighter than before I used the Neutrogena Wave. It was easy to use and control and can ber used in the shower. The cleansing pads are available for about $6.49 for about 1-2 months worth depending on how often you use the product. It is gentle enough I feel you could use it every day depending on yourt skin type.<br />  Bottom line is, if you don't want to spend alot for a ""skin rejuvenator"" than consider the Neutrogena Wave!

After one week straight no changes. I even popped into the microwave for 8 seconds still clear. Had it contained ferulic acid I would have been less skeptic because FA is a Vitamin C stabilizer. On its own Vitamin C (L-absorbic acid) is unstable and begins to oxidize once the seal is broken. Yes even pure vitamin C in water it will turn a slight yellow and begin to darken.<br /><br />But my skin did not break out a good thing.

So I of course ordered these when I seen them. Upon arrival I was very pleased with them. I absolutely loved the packaging especially the box the bows arrived in, which can be used for storage when not in use.  We took them out right away and couldn't have been happier. These bows are made very well and seem to be very sturdy. The colors/design are very nice and put together well. The colors are great and they should definitely match with anything you may need. The ribbon on these is of nice quality and it shows. They are infact the size mentioned in the add, which can sometimes be a surprise upon arrival. They are on alligator clips, which was exactly what we were wanting. These particular clips have grips on them which make them even easier. They stay in place with no problems, even during rough play. One of the best things about these is that they are very light weight. Lighter than most of our bows, especially for the size. These have a soft of silky-ness to them which I have found helps tremendously when trying to clean them. I use a baby wipe and have no issues wiping off anything that has managed to get on them. I'm so glad I found these and we were able to try them out. I have  no doubt that they will last a while to come, being they are made so well. I'm completely happy with my purchase and I will be recommending them to my friends and family.

AHVLRJDI6K2KCVNGHQACGTKSKZDA,B000G8LWZI,5.0,"I've been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!<br /><br />I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new ""Simply Radiant"" skin care system with fancy ""Soy Proteins"" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.<br /><br />I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch ""shine"" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.<br /><br />I'm back to just the Souffle morning and evening for maintenance, but I'll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!",False,1,0,1,2
AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ,B000068PBR,5.0,"I bought this trimmer two months ago.  I use it to keep my hair very short.  I have not gone to a barber ever since I bought this.  I simply turn the dial to set the guard to level 5 and cut all of my hair the same lenght.  Definitely easy to use.  On my short hair, I can probably get four complete haircuts in one charge.  This is a good trimmer for those men who like to keep their hair very short all the way around.  Use it two times and it would have paid for itself due to the fact that you were able to avoid going to a barber.<br />This is my second Norelco trimmer.  My first one was a T6000 that I bought back in February of 2001.  The battery stopped taking a charge four months ago, after almost 3 years of use.  I called Norelco to have the battery replaced, and I was then informed that they do not replace the batteries on these trimmers since replacing the battery would cost as much as buying a newer unit.  So, I ordered the newer T860 from Amazon.  The T860 functions just like the older T6000.  In addition, the T860 can also function as a corded trimmer, in the event the battery stops taking a charge.  The service life of the trimmer can extend beyond the life of the rechargeable battery by using the cord.  I am satisfied with it.<br />By the way, the reason why the battery got damaged in my older T6000 was that I kept the unit plugged in the charger stand for very long periods of time.  I later learned not to do that, as that practice will damage the battery over time.  Overcharging even a little seems to damage the battery over time.  It's best to read the directions so you will know how to properly care for the battery.  The battery basically will determine the life of the unit.  The cutters do not wear out, from what I can tell.  The motor seems durable.  So the life of the unit is really how long you can keep the internal rechargeable battery working.  Norelco's internal rechargeable Ni-Cad batteries can last a long time, if given proper care.  They seem to be of good quality.<br />I had a Norelco 885 razor, and the battery was still taking a charge after nine years.  The razor had the advantage of having a five level battery meter that tells you how much charge is left in the internal batteries.  Basically, you want to wait until there is only a little charge left before you put the unit in the charger.  It seems this trimmer is a bit different though.  The instructions on the T860 unit say to completely drain the battery.  Which would be a bit inconvenient.  With the T860 trimmer, it takes 10 hours for a full charge.  Recharge fully.  That way,  you can minimize the dreaded ""memory effect"" or voltage depression and extend the useful life of the rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeable batteries are permanently soldered inside the unit.  This trimmer unit, T860, does not have a charge meter.  I refrained from getting the pricier unit with a charge meter in order to economize.  However, my advice to you, if you're not too cost-sensitive, is to get a unit with a charge meter.  That way, you will know when to charge the unit and when to remove the unit from the charger.  That precise practice should help extend the life of the battery, and hence, the unit.",True,1,0,1,2
AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ,B000068PBL,4.0,"This is the latest shaver in Norelco's Quadra system.  The shaving heads are mounted in such a way that gives them the freedom to depress independently of one another, to better adapt to the unique contours of your face.  Another advantage to this razor is that the shaving heads can be washed under the faucet.  This is a feature that the Quadra system razors share with the more expensive Spectra system razors.<br />This razor is light-years better than my previous Norelco.  My last Norelco was the 885, bought back in 1991.  That razor always irritated my skin, especially the neck area.  Although it did last nine years.  Three years ago, I switched to the Braun Syncro system.  The Braun worked very well for me.  Anyway, I decided to give Norelco another try.  I was very surprised, and impressed, to say the least.  This Quadra shaves just as close and just as comfortable as the Braun Syncro.  And, it is very quiet.  So far, I am only getting 35 minutes of shaving time per charge.  But, I believe that the battery will reach its full capacity after a few more discharge and charge cycles.<br />For me, it is an even choice between this Norelco and the Braun.  I can readily recommend either one.  I suppose you just might have to try both and see which one will work better for you.  One thing is obvious though.  Either one will save you money in the long run, compared to using a blade shaver like the Mach 3, for example.  The long-term cost of periodically buying replacement blades for a Mach 3 or Sensor Excel can easily exceed the price of either one of the electrics.  I will admit, however, that neither of the electric razors can match the closeness of the Mach 3.",True,1,1,1,3

AH4YBVO724V3BJUUFP4DBFQGNEHQ,B01M1OFZOG,4.0,"For many years I've always straightened my hair because I cannot seem to get the hang of using curling irons to make pretty spiral curls. Wearing the same hairstyle all the time with long hair can get a bit boring so I decided to search on Amazon for styling tools that are easy to use. I initially ordered the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] and really loved the results so much that I also purchased this Rock 'n' Roller styling iron, which I affectionately call my &#34;bubble curler.&#34;<br /><br />The Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron comes with the iron itself along with a black protective glove to protect your hand from the heat of this iron since there is no clamp. The iron measures almost 15 inches in length, with the heating barrel measuring about 5 3/4 inches. The balls measure about one inch in diameter. The cord measures almost six feet so there is plenty of length to move around with it. The iron has a black ball at the top so you can hold it while using it, a safety stand that works well, an on/off switch, a temperature dial that allows you to choose among the low, medium, and high settings as well as the temperatures in between all of them, and a swivel cord so you can easily move the iron around as you use it. I found that it heats up quickly and cools off rapidly as well in case you need to pack it up in your suitcase soon after using it. The glove fits well but I didn't end up using it since it feels a bit awkward to use while trying to grip strands of hair so I took a chance and kept my hand bare, with no problems as long as I styled my hair in front of a mirror so I could watch closely what I was doing.<br /><br />I found this styling iron a bit difficult to use at first but it gets easier with practice. I just winged it and have included some pictures of my end result. There is a chart in the instructions as to what heat setting is most likely appropriate for your hair type but they recommend you start with the lowest setting and increase the heat as needed. I have wavy to medium hair so I started off using the low setting but ended up using the medium setting. I have long hair and it was fairly simple to wrap my hair around the barrel. When I got toward the end of the strands of hair, I carefully wrap them around the barrel, holding my fingers as close as I can to the styling iron without actually touching it. Then I roll the styling iron towards my head as close as I can so my hair gets curled as much as possible. I hold my hair in that position for about 40 seconds and then release it and curl my whole head. It probably took about a half hour to style all of my hair and then I finished by spraying it with hairspray. I didn't add any product to my hair before I started although you probably could if your hair works better that way.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this styling iron and really like the end result. Hopefully it will get easier to use with time. I found it a bit difficult to use because, without having a clamp on the iron, I had to hold both arms up in the air and my muscles got tired pretty quickly. I'm in fairly good shape but perhaps this will get easier with time. I actually prefer the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] because I feel it's easier to use and I love the beach waves I get from it so I will most likely use that one more but this one is still good to have. If you want spiral curls, I'd purchase the Rock 'n' Roller Styling Iron but if you prefer beach waves, I'd purchase the Deep Waver. The price is just what I wanted to spend and I like the fact that I can have more hairstyles than just straightened hair! I recommend purchasing this styling iron if you want to add some variety to your hairstyle and aren't comfortable using a regular curling iron to get spiral curls.",True,1,0,1,2

This way we can try ten soaps for the price of two, keep the ones we like and trade the rest looking for more winners.<br /><br />Ladies and germs, this is a winner. My first Ogallalla product, I tried it on the recommendation of a guy I frequently trade with whose tastes are similar in many ways and who likes and demands the same performance characteristics of his shaving soaps. When he recommends one I sit up and listen.<br /><br />So let’s talk performance. This soap, with my 26mm synthetic shaving brush, makes a ton of lather. A surprising amount. I kept adding water to get it down from “cake batter” to “pancake batter” to the soft whipped peaks and glossy sheen that lets me know it’s hydrated enough for maximum slickness. A nice thirsty shaving stick. Hooray. The ingredient list is vegan. I generally prefer soaps with tallow bases and added lanolin but I’m open minded about it. There are some vegan soaps in my keeper drawer.<br /><br />Slickness was very good. Not quite what you can get from B&M’s “Reserve” line or good old Mitchell’s Wool Fat but very close. Lather, once worked to a good sheen and soft peaks, did not dissipate on the brush or dry on my skin. Maintains hydration well. Once again, B&M does it better, but for over $4 an ounce it ought to.

It transforms the Mitchell’s experience.<br /><br />Combined with my favorite razor, the Rockwell 6s set to “3” with a Feather blade, a good aftershave lotion and cologne, I’ve got an awesome shave here.<br /><br />Provides plenty of slickness and cushion like any traditional tallow soap. But the addition of unsaponified lanolin (which also makes it hard to lather) gives this stuff its unparalleled post-shave feel. You will love your soft face after shaving with Mitchell’s and so will your wife, girlfriend or both.<br /><br />Clean off with a hot damp washcloth, then pat dry and hit with a generous amount of Speick aftershave splash. Your pores will immediately tighten up, whiskers will retract, and you will have a perfectly smooth face.<br /><br />If you are going to use Feathers, the samurai sword of DE blades, you need a slick soap like Mitchell’s to keep from cutting yourself. Mitchell’s does its job well.<br /><br />Get some. It might be your favorite too. I will always keep it in my rotation.",False,1,1,0,2

Following them, I put four drops (that's what works for me) in my palm, then rub my palms together until they feel warm. Then I pat my face with them, applying the serum all over.

I'm mean it's reeeealy soft, and not oily or greasy at all. It's AMAZING. What really has me addicted is the smell. It's not floral or citrus, or really like anything I can put my finger on. If I had to, I'd say it's faintly sweet… possibly herbal? Well, whatever it is, it's intoxicating to me. It lingers just a while after the serum dries and I thoroughly enjoy it.

However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it.

In the past, I've used soy wax (Nufree) in salons and this is also a great product because it doesn't bond to the skin making it much less painful and more to the point doesn't cause near the amount of skin irritation.  The Plum Smooth wax does the same thing but with the added bonus of having a more pleasant smell.  I also found that I had even less post-wax irritation with this than with any other wax I've used.  For my at-home waxing I've used consumer available wax strips like Veet, etc.  but these universally are low quality and, in addition to being more painful (even to an experienced waxer like me), cause irritation and sometimes even bruising/broken skin in the more sensitive areas where the skin it thinner.  This product is better than anything else I've tried and here's hoping that the results continue to be as good as the first couple times of use.  As a side note - the other reviewer had negative results and correctly stated that what works for some people may not work with others - in my experience people that have not had good results with soy wax or the Plum Smooth due to irritation it has been because of allergies or incorrect use of the product, but these are generally considered to be much gentler on the skin than any sugar waxes or products you can purchase as a consumer.",False,1,1,1,3

The downside to that is that it is so expensive. In my town, an underarm wax can cost $22 plus tip, and since the hair will grow back at different times you may end up wishing for another wax just a week later. You also have to wait until it's long enough too. Since I was tired of the cost of waxing and I don't mind the pain of waxing or plucking, I thought an epilator would be a good buy. I did a lot of research on each type and finally settled on this one about 6 months ago based on the positive reviews. I made the right choice, for sure, and it has paid for itself at least 5 times over by now.<br />Pros:<br />*It is actually better not to let the hair grow long, so that means you don't have to be hairy for long periods of time<br />*You can do it at any given time, if there is anything to pull, which is way better than a once-per month trip to the waxer's shop.<br />*It doesn't hurt as bad once you are consistent with it, just like with waxing.<br />*It is fairly easy to clean and easy to recharge<br />*The flashlight is a great tool to help see those hairs you would miss just off the ceiling lights.<br />*You can use it almost anywhere, or anywhere you have help from another pair of unwary hands.

My underarms and bikini line are my favorite places to use it.<br />*You can use it in the shower<br />*The battery lasts pretty long, like an hour<br />Cons:<br />*If you try to give yourself a brazilian wax with it by yourself, you are gonna have a bad time.

AFXVCEEIAVRQV4HHOUFBKDPD747Q,B07KRJB3FF,5.0,"Just had my first shave with this. I've used two electric razors in my life. One was an already ancient one that my dad had, about 40 years ago. Ripped each of the few hairs in my face out one by one. Then an early Norelco 3-head circular job, about 30 years ago that either sucked or I didn't know how to use. Very even stubble was the result of that. Hence my refusal to try one until my memories have faded.<br /><br />This review reflects one shave - not a long term review.<br /><br />I'm impressed. It's slower than I expected, I half-thought I could activate an app on my phone or something and I would be shaved (I'm joking!). It's pretty darn close to a manual 5-blade fresh razor.<br /><br />Here are the conditions under which I'm reporting:<br />- I'm 62, so my skin isn't exactly taut on my face.<br />- Not a heavy beard, I need to shave every day now, but not until I was about 35.<br />- This shave was with 2 days of stubble.<br />- I usually shave in the shower, using Braille to tell when a patch is smooth.<br /><br />I used the razor dry. The manual said to charge the razor before first use, but it came out of the box showing 100% charge so I went for it. The manual also says not to apply too much pressure, so I was tentative at first. It helps to apply fair pressure while moving the razor SLOWLY through that fungus that seems to grow constantly on our faces.<br /><br />Stretching my skin with other-handed fingers in most spots helped. I used a mirror just to watch the progress, but you can use your sonic sensors, AKA ears, to tell when the blades are and aren't removing stubble. I don't think a mirror is at all necessary, YMMV.<br /><br />While I've been writing this, I've used Braille again to check on the usual trouble spots - I can just grab the mower and run it over the rough bits while I'm doing this. You could do this easily while driving somewhere - no risk of a small knick, and the aural attention that it takes doesn't really distract from driving.<br /><br />I didn't notice when I ordered this razor that it came with an extra foil. Nice detail, since the foil is easy to damage being thin (as it should be). The kit comes with a carrying bag, which is nice to keep everything together while traveling. I would find a small rigid container for the extra foil if I were to travel with that - it could easily get bent in the carrying bag knocking around with all the bits. The foil is too long for the old canisters from film cameras, but a cut-off from a roll of Xmas paper would suffice.<br /><br />The grip is comfortable and makes the shaving head easy to maneuver. The carrying bag contains everything in a small package - I'm a Cardinal (Archbishops and above don't shave) in the Church of Small Luggage and I will happily carry this instead of a couple of manual razors on any trip.<br /><br />Finally (applause erupts from the crowd),  very nearly close shave as a manual razor, a little slower than a manual razor, works very well dry (absolutely unlike a manual razor, though I've tried that also and it does sort of work).<br /><br />Buy it.

Never had acne until I reached my mid 20's. So as a fair skin woman in her mid 30's my focus is to lessen the severity of my outbreaks, and to keep my skin looking youthful and CLEAR! Like other women in my predicament I have spend loads of money on what seems like millions of products sometimes they work, then after a couple of months they cease to have any effect. So besides incorporating multivitamins into my life (B complex, Flaxseed oil, MSM, DMAE, etc) which I take pretty consistently, I drink plenty of water or as much as I can take, eat fairly healthy (no soda, no juice, no candy, no chips, little to no fast food) and of course I exercise. All these things will play into how healthy your skin will and can be! So on a recent trip to South Carolina, I ran into a Marshall's and I always check out the skincare section. Now within the last couple of months my skin will begin to clear up completely then BAM I will get a medium red nodule, or inflamed whitehead.... UGH!

AGJJRF6REVHJ4MNHG6AMCRBYYNZA,B000FEF1V4,4.0,"Ok, here's my summary review of this trimmer.<br /><br />I've had a T900 trimmer for a few years now and wanted to upgrade to a new and hopefully better trimmer. I've had it now for two weeks and here's what I think...<br /><br />* The vacuum is great, period. When shaving with my Norelco T900, the shavings would fly all over the place --- in the sink, behind the faucet, in between the handles of the faucet, and on the floor. With the vacuum set on low, I barely see any clippings now! Now, my wife doesn't get mad any more!<br /><br />* The height adjustment can be easily set, and unlike other reviews mention, I haven't accidentally changed the setting without knowing.<br /><br />* The clipper works great and easily cuts/trims without any effort. This is an upgrade from my T900.<br /><br />* Battery holds its charge pretty well. You can use it with a power cord also when the battery is low.<br /><br />* The smaller trimmer is a now a separate attachment. My T900 has it attached to the trimmer, and it can be popped up or down when needed. To me, this is a downgrade as it is not as convenient.<br /><br />* The parts seem somewhat delicate. I try to be careful as to not cause damage.<br /><br />Overall, the price is good, it works well, and I'm glad I purchased it, and would recommend it to all.",True,1,1,0,2

Next time I’ll try capping some product on glass and using my own brush to apply. The lashes are pretty good compared to other brands. The 5 magnets as opposed to 4 is nice. I had some trouble with the corners staying down. It’s a little tedious to get the liner timing and placement of the lashes just right.  Not the most comfortable, but what falsies are? The eyeliner is really difficult to remove even with eye makeup remover. A dab of coconut oil on a Qtip worked the best but did not entirely remove the product., which is why I took of a star.

I was sold.<br /><br />Norelco Reflex Plus shavers combine 4 features pioneered by Norelco and improved over time. Rotary heads reduce the vibration common to reciprocating shavers. Floating heads individually hug the skin. Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave. Everything rides on a set of pivoting platforms that bulge slightly at the center of the head assembly.  The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.<br /><br />I've been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn't a surprise for my skin. It was as close and comfy as I'd expect from a Norelco.<br /><br />The real revelation was the sound. The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black & Decker DustBuster. The Reflex Plus is so quiet, you can actually hear the cutters slice off the whiskers and then fall silent on the next pass over the same area. This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn't nearby. You could actually shave by the sound alone!<br /><br />A somewhat poignant note: Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind. When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie. Still, I miss seeing the words ""MADE IN HOLLAND"" on the bottom of every Norelco I've owned.<br /><br />Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.",False,1,0,1,2

That is basically the whole bottle... so if you can afford to spend $30 on every shampoo, maybe it will work better for you. I used one pump on the top of my hair, one pump on the bottom and then after I rinsed it out, one more pump to leave on my ends. The first two days it made my hair look supermodel perfect... after that, it was so disgustingly greasy that I couldn't handle it. I started to work back a shampoo into my routine here and there to help with that- but now every single time I use it, its nothing but grease and weighed down matted down hair.

The reviews here regarding whether this product was a fake or not made me a little leery.  So, I'm reviewing the real Josie Maran Vibrancy foundation and not the Amazon version, real or not.<br /><br />As usual, I ordered the lightest shade, RG5.  It's a nearly perfect match.  It's described as being for fair skin with neutral undertones.  I typically prefer foundations with pink undertones, but this actually worked really well for me.<br /><br />The consistency is on the thin, runny side, which isn't surprising since oil is an ingredient.  Having said that, this foundation sits on the skin so beautifully.  It looks like real skin.  It's definitely not a matte foundation, so if that's your preference, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation gives you more luminous, dewy-looking skin.  I don't typically care for dewy foundations, but again, I was surprised to like this one.  It just made my skin look healthy and plump.  It didn't look at all heavy, which is great because it didn't settle into my fine lines.  I did notice it took a while to set.  Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.

We ordered this to compliment my daughter's Mad Hatter Halloween costume and honestly, it looked like a hot mess when it arrived.  The bangs were going everywhere, the curls were tangled, there was no part...it was awful.<br /><br />My daughter, who is 12, has long, VERY thick blonde hair.  When the wig arrived, we tried it on with her hair down to make sure it fit.  It did.  Fast forward to Halloween...I braided her hair and pulled it into a knot at the back of her head.  Lo and behold, the wig wouldn't fit...it just kept sliding off her head.  That was my mistake...I should have tested it with a bun when it arrived.  Having said that, my daughter is incredibly petite...her doctor predicts she won't surpass 5' when she's full grown  Obviously, her head isn't that large.  My point?  If you're an adult or are purchasing this for a teen or big child, it likely won't fit.  I finally had to put her hair in a low bun at the nape of her neck to make it work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because her natural hair was so low, we couldn't do the up-do we had planned because her bun showed if we did.  We ended up leaving it down, brushing it out, putting bobby pins in strategic places to help it frame her face and to contain it, and then I hair sprayed it in place.  Styling was especially difficult because the wig is sparse.  It's a lot of work to hide the netting underneath.  The netting is a yellow-beige color and stands out like bright white against the purple and teal.  We finally got it looking decent though, and she actually got many compliments on it throughout the evening, hence the higher star rating despite all the complaints.<br /><br />Once the wig was brushed and styled, the waves looked beautiful.

For the mix brown I give 4 stars.The face front is about 2 inches and is meant to be cut and plucked for a natural look. I did neither in the photo. I just folded it under the the front as I'm afraid that cutting will make it look lifted in the front and obviously show it's a wig without some glue to put it down. The color is not exactly what I wanted. I was hoping it would be a darker brown. It's kinda a mousey brown and alittle strange in my opinion. It will need to be restyle in the front as some waves/curls flattened out by how it was packed in transport. The part is both a plastic fake skin and a mesh on top. You can see the mesh upon close examination. Makeup might help to conceal this.... Or make it worse. What I did like was the fullness and length. The weft was not too easy to be seen even when pulling hair apart. This is good compared to other brands where the wefts are often very visible, especially in the back and crown of a unit. Because the simulated scalp is narrow, you won't be able to change the part. It's also a bit flat near the part so it's gonna take some work to give a bit of volume. I would have enjoyed this much more had the color been a rich brown and if the scalp was a bit more realistic. Would I wear in public? Probably not. Would this be good for photo shoots or costumes ? yes. Would I buy other colors from this brand? Yes and I haven't done that with other brands on Amazon. For the purple ombre: I give 3 stars. It doesn't have the lace in front. This is more pure costume. The black is very shiney and the front of wig where the part is shows a bit of the black backing for construction. If it laid more flat and had the lace I would have given the purple ombre 4 stars. Dull the shiney with some powder like dry shampoo or maybe even dark eyeshadow. The fake scalp is actually better on the purple ombre compared to the brown mix. The ombre for the blonde is also a 4 star. Hair at the crown is a bit flat but the rest of the style is beautiful. The brown to blonde has the 2 inch lace like the long brown one. It's not as full on the head but you don't see the wefts unless you pull it apart a bit.  I feel the color is much more realistic. Hair feels pretty good for a synthetic. Note if you play too much , it will get a knotty feel. Again, good for photos.

The bangs looked nicer then most but it just wasn't for me. Fake scalp also not best I've seen but concealer would probably fix that. The top had no volume and I don't mean amount of hair. It was slicked down really tight. I tried to shake it a bit with my fingers to see if it would gain some life but it didn't, plus a bunch of hair fell out.  This super flat look near the fake scalp and with a mid part that cannot be moved is just gonna make me look like the Amish.

The best feature is that it’s cordless (with the exception of when it’s charging, of course). I’ve had mine for a few weeks and I’ve only had to plug it in once so the charge is lasting. For those of you who’ve never used a water flosser before, they can be powerful and messy (with water getting everywhere) so it’s best to keep and use them in the shower so that the water is confined/contained inside the shower during use. This was actually my dentists recommendation – so this being a cordless flosser was very important!

AFWBLJNGV5OEUKBNXAEMPMNGLJWQ,B000UK2VRK,4.0,"My husband has complained about shaving irritating his skin, so when I saw this shaver I ordered one for him. Here is what he had to say after using it:<br /><br />I've used Norelco shavers for years, but never a ""wet"" system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver. When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner. This was no problem following the easy to read instruction manual.<br /><br />To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button. This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads. Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver. I found that I use three pumps of conditioner while shaving: one for each side of my face and one for my neck.<br /><br />Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin. Because of this, in recent years I've starting shaving every other day. So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men's would normally be. The shaver has no problem coping with this. It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs. However, it begins to have problems with three days of growth.<br /><br />I also have a mustache and goatee, which has always caused me to use a razor to shave along its edge. The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry skin.<br /><br />The shaver also comes with a beard trimming device. Just snap off the triple shave head and replace it with the trimmer. (Conditioner cannot be used when the trimmer is installed.) The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless. It just doesn't want to cut any hairs.

I read a ton on reviews on these peel off polishes and finally chose these not expecting a whole lot. I have 100% no complaints!!! But I will say that I guess it all depends on what you are wanting out of your nail polish. If you are wanting it to last like it lasts on artificial nails... this is not for you. If you are wanting options and to not have to deal with nail polish remover...THIS IS FOR YOU!!!<br /><br />I have loved painting my nails and having polished nails since a kid. I've always hated nail polish remover. I have thin nails and can't change my polish often because nail polish remover dries my nails out and makes them even weaker and it stinks...even nail polish stinks for that matter.<br />To make the polish last I've always added a top coat about every day or two and I've learned how to do touch ups that hardly show when the polish on tip of the nail (natural nails) chipped or wore away, so that I didn't have to use acetone any more often than necessary. But it was really self defeating because the more polish I had on, the more acetone I had to use to remove it.<br />So anyway...I got these little gems in...they are small....but then again, when you compare the price to buying regular polish ( I buy OPI normally ) and the fact that you are getting several colors of these for the price you'd pay for 1 or 2 bottles of decent regular polish, it's not a bad deal at all.<br />I tried them right away and<br />#1...they are hardly smell at all! I don't smell them unless I actually hold my nails or the bottle to my nose to smell them.<br />#2...the polish went on fine. It's a little thick, but it settles down smooth as it dries.<br />#3 I love some of the colors and some will be just for having fun, but they are fun t play with. 5 colors are opaque and 4 are transparent, so they are fun mixing and matching. I like using the transparent ones as top coats on the opaque ones.<br />#4 They lasted about 3 days with no chips and very very little edge wear (with the daily addition of a top coat for shine) until I couldn't stand it any longer and had to try to peel them off. Some of the reviews said they were hard to peel off, but I had no problem at all. And all but one came off in one full piece! Amazing!!! So easy and NO ACETONE!!! And the other thing I like is that with regular polish, I would sometimes try and peel of as much as I could before using the acetone and some would come off but my nail always seemed super dry under the polish even when it was peeled off. That is not the case with these at all. My nails were not dry at all. They were still healthy and not dry at all!!!<br />Oh and the BONUS ....since they peel off, any polish that gets on to your skin peels off easy too after it dries. :)",True,1,0,1,2

It says to lightly spritz the mask and then heat it for 30 seconds in the microwave, which I did, but since it didn't feel hot enough, I put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds and, for me, that was the perfect temperature.<br /><br />Cold: I tried freezing it to use on my eyes, since my allergies have been killing me this season and my eyes have been quite puffy and itchy, and I must say that I was rather pleased. It was cool, but definitely not too cold to place directly on my skin/eyes to soothe them. This time around, I could barely smell the lavender.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product but I wish the company had also enclosed a nice bag to seal the eye mask in when you're done using it. In the directions, it says to keep it in a sealed bag to help keep the lavender smell last longer so I had assumed that they would have included one with it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but it does not change my opinion of the product.",False,1,1,0,2

It says to use it a day or two before epilating, and it's super-gentle... almost feels like it's not doing anything, but I found it's more effective and more comfortable (if more slow) than just using a loofah. The ""wait 2 days"" advice is good because otherwise your skin gets sensitive<br /><br />And some thoughts on epilation in general:<br />* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it's very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren't bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.)<br />* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you'll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back but are still too small to get. It's less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren't really visible. So if you think someone's going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don't bother doing anything for a month or so, you'll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.<br />* Remember that the exfoliation is important to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don't turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you'll have to do that anyway. And this unit's exfoliator is more gentle than a loofah<br />* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they'll banish them but don't? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it's fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time",False,1,1,1,3

The entire thing is made in China and it is crap. The manual is literally translated probably by a Chinese person and it makes no sense what so ever. It started breaking in less than a year and nothing is operational. The steam generator has a hole in it and is not repairable, I spent many $100's trying to figure out what was wrong with it. The sauna stove broke and only one element worked, it took forever to heat and the new stove they sent me flips my breaker within 5 minutes of turning it on. This is the worst purchase on the internet, all of these units are. I am not alon. Many many unhappy customers out there.

The only thing that I have disliked about it is that it is a little heavy, and since my hair is super curly, I have to run it through my hair a lot, and my hand does get tired. Even if I'm rotating hands, it still takes a really long time. Even though my hair is short, it's just really thick and curly. So I don't love straightening it, and my go-to when I am straightening my hair had been the straightening brush. But I actually like this one better.<br />The LED screen is very easy to read, even while in use. The hair brush bristles are very nice, and seemingly durable as none of them broke off while I was straightening my hair. And again, it's not as heavy as the hair straightening brushes that has been the latest craze.<br />Its very user friendly, and it heats up super fast. The rotating cord is a nice feature, I don't think that I would ever straighten my hair if I had to constantly untangle the cord. That's just another frustration that doesn't even need to be added on, in my opinion. But that's a nice design.<br />When you are curling your hair, keep the black piece on the curler facing your head, otherwise it will be a MESS. If you have super curly hair like I do, it will be PERFECT for taming down your curls, which is exactly how I use it.<br />Also, don't use this on your hair if its wet. Just wait until it's dry, I get an eye twitch when I see somebody or hear somebody straightening their hair when it's wet. It does nothing but kill your hair, causes split ends, and you can't come back from something like that. So, just wait until your hair is dry.<br />Make sure your hair also has ZERO tangles otherwise it WILL get stuck and THAT is no fun at all. Tiny strands will also be best, unless you like untangling your hair...<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review.",False,1,1,1,3

They are very easy to fill and dispense from, when you are ready to use your lotion or shampoo or facial cleanser, but they are also the right size to give you enough for a trip. The bottles come in different colors, so you can sort of color-code your products, however, they don't include enough colors. As a result, there are really only four bottles that can be used for travel, without labeling. Given that three are the white color, all of those will be for hand lotion. They are really convenient for attaching to a hook on a bag, which is great for me because my hands dry out so easily. Since I know what color the original bottles are, for my products, I love that they are different colors, but, again, they need more colors. My shampoo is blue. My body wash is white. My facial cleanser is green. My lotion is orange. The list goes on. I am giving these five stars because they work very well, have a nice thick top portion to hold that clip, so that they don't break off, and the clips themselves are nice medium-duty clips that really hold the little bottles in place. These are high quality for a great price and made with food-grade silicone, so they are non-toxic and won't leach any chemicals into my products, which means I won't be putting anything bad on my skin. Even though you might have to separate them out, unless you use products with color additives like pink-colored strawberry scented shampoo, and only use four for travel, while the other two are for different use, they are still really well made and easy to fill and dispense and attach and carry around. I highly recommend these. I look forward to seeing more colors and more multi-color sets. That's basically what we all need isn't it, for everything to come in different sets with more choices as to customizing the variations in the sets that we purchase. Some would want all pink.

Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />🐱For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />🐰I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />🐰Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />🐇Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />🐇I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen.

Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure.

Just purrs, cries at me if it hurts & continues to purr & reaches for me when I stop.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is attractive & looks nice left out on my coffee table. The downside is that the handle is very thin & is pretty short. I have very small fine boned hands (I'm a wee Irish lass) & need to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have large hands, I'm not sure this will work. Also, because it's not ergonomic it's really only good for short periods of use esp. if you have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I like the comb even though the quality could be better. A wider, longer more comfortable handle made with a stronger wood would have been pawsome.

I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a slow processes but it keeps me from accidentally over filling the bottles. The tube that goes into the bottle is plenty long. It actually curls up in a C on the very bottom of the bottle. You can cut it if you want, but I leave it as is, I think they function better with the long tube. The stickers are a bit of a joke. I can't really fit ""Bug Spray"" on one tiny label.

I don't love it.<br /><br />I have very pale skin with pink undertones that is uber-sensitive and I have to be very careful about sun exposure. Anything can make me break out in hives or eczema, at any time, even if I used it daily for years. Thankfully, PF products have never done that to me, in almost a decade.<br /><br />As for this product, the shades are where I take some issue. They worked best for my tone in summer, but now, in winter -- I'm shopping for a different product.<br /><br />* The dark shade is really mahogany-like, so I have to blend, blend, blend in daylight or risk looking like I smeared mud on my face. It's good for shading jawline and cheekbones with a light touch at temples if you need it. Beware, though. If you are very pale, you want a very light touch with this one.<br /><br />*The medium shade is very subtle and helps blend and soften the dark. It also works well as a matte bronzer, around sides of the nose, and wherever you need just a little definition. This is the best shade of the bunch, honestly. At least for my skin tone.<br /><br />* The light shade is, frankly, worthless to me. It gives my skin a pasty, chalky look and looks heavy. Yuck. I occasionally use it in tiny spots as a concealer, but as a contour powder, it just looks like I put on way too much setting powder or something. Instead, I use my lightest shade of matte eyeshadow (also a PF product) and a higher-end illuminator for highlighting. Those results are beautiful, frankly, even on my 38 year old skin.<br /><br />All in all, PF's contour colors are suitable for pale skin, but may be better on other slightly darker or warmer skin tones, or on summer tanned skin.",True,1,0,1,2

I can sanitize them better than any other rests I've used. The problems I've had with most of the gel neck rests, is they are only good until they get wet, then they slip off. I've tried the gel rests with the built in suction cups before. They are better than the ones without, but they eventually give way when wet as well. The major pro with this item is the suction cups are made of material that are not gel. They adhere terrifically. They are built around the gel and attached that way. I'm assuming one would want to keep that area dry in between uses so it doesn't eventually break down there.<br />The only problem I have is the single cup does not reach to the outside under the sink. Not sure if my sink has too thick of a rest? Either way, it is not made for universal use. Nevertheless, it still stays on, the single one just stays un attached. It does get caught on the chair sometimes if I am not careful when I bring the client up from the bowl.

The only issue is, while my lashes ARE long, they are ""Unruly"".  They stick out in multiple directions and if I don't use a curler, they look horrible.  Over three years ago I purchased a Shu Uemura online from their site.  I was happy with it and it performed well, but the pads wore out and when I went online to purchase another one, I was disappointed to see that not only were they purchased by L'Oreal, they were completely out of stock on eyelash curlers on their own website!  The internet is FLOODED with counterfeit Shu Uemuras and frankly I didn't want that either.  So I went in search of an alternative.<br /><br />I purchased another high rated curler, the Billy B Eyelash curler online hoping that it would do the trick.  The Billy B one is ""different"" from the Uemura--it has a more rounded shape and I was hoping it would do a fabulous job.  Unfortunately I found that I had a harder time getting the rounded Billy B up next to my eyelash base, and inevitably it would miss my corner lashes entirely.  I'm sure the Billy B works well for people with smaller, more rounded eyes, and in all honesty the pads on it were great.  It just wasn't the right fit for me.<br /><br />So again I went searching and that's when I stumbled across the Bella & Bear.  This thing is awesome and with a single coat of mascara for work, my eyelashes look a mile long and very well separated.  I can't say enough good things about how easy this was to put up against my eyeline and get a good curl.  The handle fits my hand well and the spring loaded mechanism on this means you don't have to press all that hard to achieve a good curl.  It's flatter and not as rounded as the Billy B, so if your eyes are longer and flatter, this one should be able to easy grab from corner to corner without missing any lashes.  In fact, when I lined up my curlers side by side, you can see the shape of this one is more like the Uemura than the Billy B.<br /><br />The curler arrives packaged in a box, so you won't have to worry about it being broken in shipment.<br /><br />In all, I'm so happy with this eyelash curler that I will never go back to another brand.  So long as this one never gets broken I should be in business for a very long time.  I've already recommended it to a friend to use on her daughter's long eyelashes during dance recitals.

It does not leave the eye area feeling or looking greasy. It has no detectable fragrance and it also does not sting my eyes. I let the Jillaroo Eye Cream absorb for about 2-3 minutes before applying any additional cosmetics to my eye area (mascara, eye line, etc.).  Only a very small amount of the Jillaroo Eye Cream is needed and I anticipate the bottle will at least two months or more.<br /><br />I’ve been using the Jillaroo Eye Cream for 5 days, twice a day (morning & evening) to give the product a good test. I’m really happy with the results. It definitely helps smooth away the fine lines around my eyes. I’m seeing small improvements to my eye area.

One could spend upwards of $70.00, with comparable brush sets.  Yikes!!  This set is much more affordable.  The brush handles are solid and bristles are firmly attached.  Some brushes are softer than others.<br /><br />So, if they are quality brushes and the price is reasonable, why am I only rating them 4 stars?

I believe it's because the bristles are stiffer than what I usually use.<br />*No case to keep them clean, which leads me to look for alternative solutions.

I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!",False,1,1,0,2

Unfortunately, they’re simply too small for an adult face...I’m not even sure they’d work for a child.  The frame is surprisingly comfortable against the face, and it did indeed create a pocket/bubble around my nose and mouth.  However, the frames are so small, I literally can’t open my mouth to talk without my lower lip slipping uncomfortably out of the frame...and I have a pretty average sized face!  If you don’t talk to anyone while wearing a mask, this is a cool little find.  If you do talk, or just breathe heavily (like at the gym), this will never, ever work for you...not even close.  I did try cutting off the bottom of the frame, where it rests on the chin.  This helped, but the edges of the frame end up pushing into my face, which I’m guessing would be uncomfortable after a few minutes, and would definitely leave marks.  Oh well, I tried!",False,1,1,0,2
AGNVHS4AY4B7UMI67FO3WLRTELPQ,B07JCYGJC3,4.0,"This unit is comparable to my very basic travel Waterpik flosser. In fact it has several features that the basic model lacks for around the same price. This unit has three speeds, whereas the entry level Waterpik only has one. The fastest speed is comparable with the one speed on my Waterpik, and it’s the only speed I need. This unit has a charge light (blinks until charged) while there is no such light on the comparably priced Waterpik. This device has about the same sized reservoir as the Waterpik, but because of the design, it’s on the bottom as opposed to along the sides of the unit, the result being that it makes it a lot bulkier, which is unfortunate in a travel water flosser. Unfortunately, there is no advantage to this design as like the Waterpik, it begins to stop pumping water as the tank gets lower, forcing the user to keep the unit vertical in order to get to the water at the very bottom of the reservoir, which can become quite awkward while trying to get around the teeth and gums. I’ve owned several of these, and to be fair, they all suffer from this same problem.<br /><br />One more thing: this unit comes with a nice case and a stash of attachments (which are usually found in home units and don’t generally come with portable units ,) none of which I have much use for, but I guess it’s good to know they’re there. It does include two of the standard water flosser adaptors, so two people can use it.<br /><br />The only thing that remains to be seen is how long this puppy will last.

It does seem to add a bit of volume to our hair.  We tried this on dry and wet hair and noticed more volume to dry hair (which makes sense because there less weight to dry hair).  I LOVE the colors and that it's padded.  The s-shaped design of the bristles are a new thing for me but it does seem to help with detangling - it doesn't pull to hard, very gentle.  The padding is not excessive but really helps with snarled hair.  I think this works BETTER than some of the detangle wet brushes you see in stores.<br /><br />The handle is a nice silicone grip, the bristles feel light weight but solid - not breakable.  Another plus - when brushing my daughters hair (she's 5) if I accidently snag her ear, she said it doesn't hurt as bad as the other brushes we've used before!  I don't brush hard but some of the other brushes I've used before have been so rough on her ear that she has cried.  :(  This one does not!  No more crying!!!

There doesn't seem to be a company name on anything. The product looks the same and the box I received is shown in other photos, so I believe I got the right thing.<br /><br />As the manual says, ""Normal people use or stop using, ask the doctor after doctor."" Yes, the manual is that poorly translated. I'm O.K. with a little grammar error here and there, but this was hard to understand. It doesn't make one feel confident in the quality. I don't even think it mentioned the microcurrent pegs. Do you need to use them or are they optional? What do they do? I really don't know after reading the manual.<br /><br />I can tell you that without the pegs in, the eye part dug in and felt horrible. I adjusted the mask strap to very loose, so it wasn't that. With the pegs in, the pegs in my forehead dug in and left marks that lasted over 30 minutes later, and one spot was still sore the next day. The microcurrent on just the lowest setting was a bit uncomfortable. Maybe it would be better when wearing a face mask, which is encouraged and which I had wanted to try.<br /><br />The eye holes do not block all the light from my eyes. The manual says to close eyes or use pads or eye shades. Dermatologists actually say to use blackout or opaque goggles.<br /><br />I didn't find it that heavy. Just awkward and painful.

Ok I've had luck with a couple mud masks on here and one of those I really liked but,... I can only use the one I really loved every couple of months because it has peel like ingredients and that's not the type of mask to use weekly or bi weekly . This type of mask could be used at least weekly without harsh affects. I was definitely skeptical about the smaller pores claim but it's true !!!! I had my daughter do a video on her iPod and even though it wasn't really noticeable in the mirror afterwards to me at least, on the video the larger pores I have were actually smaller. I cannot figure out how to upload a video from anything other then my iPad so later this week I'm going to get a video or pictures on my iPad so I can post the difference. It's crazy how a mud can do this much without me noticing any major intenseness that I get from my other favorite mud mask, so pretty much I'm getting results without the burning, oh and this is also WAY more then what I get in the jar of my other stuff. So a. It's more, b. It's more affordable, c. It's easier on my skin and yeah you get the picture,. This is definitely the best mud mask you can get for the money and it really shrinks your pores, or my pores at least. My combination skin feels good and &#34;normal&#34; for two to three days after. Now that might not be a lot to you, but for me it's a miracle because usually by day two I'm oily on my problem areas and that's not fun.

The hair is very thick and beautiful and shiny but not too shiny where it looks to fake but you can always spray some dry shampoo on it to help with that shininess. I was very surprised to receive the package and it came with the wig which is wrapped in a hairnet keep it from tingling in the box and also came with a package of bobby pins and a wig cap which I was worried I had a purchase in addition to this but I'm so glad that it came with it.<br /><br />The wig at edge of your hairline does look fake and it could be hard to work with but I think you could definitely wear it with a  baseball cap or a beanie over this week and it would look really cute which is how I plan on wearing it. I love the stone gray color it's not too light and silvery but it's a very nice toned down gray and it's so beautiful as you can see in the pictures it's very long .. comes down to about my mid back and it doesn't tangle that easily which is nice. It's very bouncy and I love it!!

AELHX3SODSPSMM7JIYVN24WKXRUA,B01AU4Z2TE,4.0,"I've been using my Clarisonic on and off for the past few years and it's a pain to purchase the replacement brushes for that. It also kind of grosses me out that the bacteria can live in those bristles..the ones that are supposed to DEEP CLEAN you face! I've been wanting to try the Foreo Luna for a while but that costs $200!  this item looks almost identical to that Luna cleansing brush. My friend uses her Luna and swears by it now. I compared hers to this one and i think the shape of this facial brush is a lot more practical since it comes to that point at the top which is great around the eye, nose, mouth areas. However, looking at the Luna bristles and the bristles on this unit you can tell the Luna has their bristles closer and also has a great variety of  brush levels which their claim is to more efficiently cleanse the skin meeting the specific needs of different facial areas... compared to the Sytles II, this unit only has 2 types of bristles.  The Luna says it cleanses with 8,000 pulsations per minute, but this unit says it can &#34;reach 32,000 times per minute massage design if high frequency vibration&#34; ...which i'm not sure how true that is..and what that even means.... what is 32,000 times? What is it referring to?...this leads me to my other gripe with this product...........the instructions!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I wish this unit had BETTER INSTRUCTIONS...I was reading it and i'm so confused - it doesn't say how many modes it has and what each mode is used for..but it mentions &#34;modes&#34; have eight gears?<br /><br />Here's the &#34;operation&#34; instructions..please try to decipher what it means... and yes i know there's typos..but that is how it READS on the instruction manual...&#34;each mode has eight gear, may adjust the intensity according to your needed. According to the intermediate key open product cleaning mode for the first tiem. According to the second closed products the intensity of each mode can be though the + and - buttons to increase&#34;............excuse me what? anyway ...<br /><br />Here are my instructions!!!<br />1.) Charge the unit to full before first use. Flashing means it's charging and when it stops blinking it is fully charged.<br /><br />2.) Wet the unit and your face, apply some face wash and turn the unit on to cleanse your whole face for 2 minutes. This unit has 2 modes, cleanse and massage. When you press on the button between the - and + you have it on cleanse mode (the faster vibration) and you can adjust the vibration intensity higher or lower depending on what you prefer. When you press the middle button again it turns off ..when you press it one more time it will turn onto the massage mode (slower vibration) you can adjust the speed of vibration in this mode as well.<br />  -The unit does NOT have a self timer so don't expect this unit to shut off after 2 minutes of cleaning. It also says it has &#34;acoustic cleaning&#34; which i thought meant it would beep every 30 seconds indicating you should move to another part of your face (ex. left cheek, right cheek, chin and then forehead - like the clarisonic does) but does NOT so you need to keep track of how long you want to wash your face for with this.<br /><br />3) Shut the unit off when you're finished by clicking the middle button between the - and +. Pat the unit dry or leave it where it can air dry.<br /><br />One thing i like about this type of facial brush is that you don't need to replace any brush heads on this unit - it makes for more hygienic. This Styles II facial brush also claims to reverse signs of aging and restoring youth in your skin. I'm only 27 so i can't really speak to this claim, i don't have may wrinkles but i hope this is a great start for preventative measures.<br /><br />This unit also claims to be a durable travel sized facial brush - it feels very light weight which i like because i don't want a bulky unit, i really like that the cord is very small and doesn't need a stand charging unit like the clarisonic. I haven't used this enough to know how long one charge can hold but I'll let you know once i continue to use this consistently. Be sure to read the instructions because it says you NEED to charge the unit fully before your first use. When you plug it in you will see the light at the bottom to start flashing indicating that it is actively charging. I hope this unit will last forever as it claims - wouldn't that be AMAZING! :)<br /><br />I've already used this unit last night and i can say that my face felt very smooth and clean afterwards. I think it really preps the skin well for your serums and treatments at night, which is KEY for those products to work. If you don't exfoliate and clean your skin - it won't allow your products to actively work!<br /><br />I'm really excited for the 100% money back guarantee! I've only had this unit for one night so I don't know how i like it yet for the long term but I'm glad that this warranty is here in case it doesn't work well for my skin or if it breaks....<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Compact and easy to travel with<br />• Cute color!<br />• Comes with a charging cable ...which it came with a case too.<br />• Waterproof so you can use it in the shower<br />• Rechargeable - you can see the image where I'm charging the unit and the light is blinking. Once it stops blinking i'm assuming that is when it's fully charged.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• The plug for the adapter to connect seems like it could rip over time - you can see it in the picture, it's very flimsy...<br />• The user manual has very odd grammar and is hard to understand which side is for &#34;massaging&#34; and which side if for &#34;cleansing&#34;.  PLEASE edit your instructions so we all understand how to properly use it.<br />• Does NOT have a self timer and it does NOT beep to indicate when to move to another part of your face like the clarisonic or Luna do.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review. I love face products and purchasing things on Amazon so this is truly my honest review.  I think this is worth the $40 price tag for what it does. All in all - the Styles II facial brush does clean the face well, the vibrations are something to get used to.",False,1,1,1,3

The tiny small jar will probably do at least 100 nails based on the amount I just used for 10 fingers . Steps- You do your gel nails exactly like you always do them, and after your topcoat is cured, you take the eyeshadow applicator, barely dip it into the powder, and buff it over your nail like you are putting on eyeshadow but rub it in really well like blending. You do NOT dip your finger into the powder. You do NOT put it on your wet nail You put It on the dry topcoat, and buff it in, wipe off the excess with a dry brush or a cotton ball, then do another topcoat and cure that. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I am not sure how it will wear. I will update my review later. Please look at the online directions for this and don’t be stupid!

AFEOQZ7V5WXEKIIPXME6XNLQQIUQ,B00JG8DY0A,3.0,"I had been using High Molecular Weight HA for a couple of weeks on my face/ hair with nice moisturizing results. But at some point I read on beauty blogs and publications that since Low Molecular Weight HA is better absorbed through the skin, that it was a much better option for the face. Made sense to me. Because of this I bought a LMW HA serum to put on my skin. This serum felt differently, watery yet more drying that the HMW HA (HMW can initially feel a bit drying on the skin). My face also felt irritated ( I have acne-prone skin) after the first days of using it. I still decided to buy this powder and the results very similar to the serum I bought.<br /><br />So I decided to do some research on the difference between both, the HMW and the LMW, because I could not understand why the LMW, which is supposed to be a far better option for the skin (according to the beauty industry) , did not give me the good results I have with the HMW. Interestingly enough I found this: &#34;Transepidermal water loss increased by 55.5% with low-molecular weight , and was reduced by 28% with crosslinked resilient , and by 16% with HMW&#34;. So more water loss with LMW? Not good.<br /><br />I also noted this: &#34;There is abundant experimental evidence from the human physiology and biochemistry literature to support the basic notion that LMW-HA is inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and associated with adult scarring phenotypes rather than fetus-like, scar-free, truly regenerative healing.  The latter is what we want in an any aesthetic procedure, or topical adjunct to a procedure, or just for topical use.&#34; This part here may explain why my face felt irritated and even got a mild breakout after using the LMW HA. More info on this on Barefacedtruth. They have detailed explanation and comments on this.<br /><br />I did give this product a 3-star because it is nicely packaged, has the detailed info on the product, etc. 2 stars down for being marketed as a potent moisturizer.",True,1,1,1,3

Although I go to the dentist every 6 months I wanted to try and combat the coffee staining with the whitening strips as a extra backup. Everything came well packaged. There were 14 pouches in the box that you open by pulling the tab. These have a slight after taste that wasn't bad at all. It didn't taste too much like medicine, but more of a mint flavored toothpaste. I simply applied to strips and watched one of my favorite shows and by the time it was over then it was time to remove the strips. The strips were easy to apply and stayed on until I removed them.

I assumed it's because it is a cheap product.  I also noticed that in the serum, I had white clumps which I assumed was due to the freezing temperatures outside at the time.  I also noticed this product had a very astringent smell -- similar to alcohol.<br /><br />Usage:<br />I had been using it twice daily after cleansing, toning, and my essence.  I am used to using a serum, but this product seriously made my face super red every time I applied it.  I assumed it was due to a niacin conversion on my skin, but after a couple weeks, I started breaking out more than ever.  I noticed that my skin was completely sensitive, red, and everything would sting my face.  I did not think it was this product at first, but after i stopped using this product completely, the redness and sensitivity stopped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Do not buy this product.  In my case, this product made my skin worse than it has ever been along with being super crazy sensitive.  I do not recommend this to anyone, but perhaps I received a bad batch?  The lot/manufacturing stamp on the product is ""8LB"" if anyone with the same lot/manufacturing stamp is having a similar issue...<br />However, if you are looking for a niacinamide+zinc formula, I would recommend Revolution Skincare Niacinamide+Zinc from Ulta instead.

AF6ROQSUO4A3ODLMUY4Z22MJTYNQ,B001LY7FRK,5.0,"I've tried at least a dozen shave soaps, maybe two dozen.  MWF is my go-to, standard. I leave it in a shave bowl in a drawer.  I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  Wet and repeat for more water if needed. Lather around your face further as needed.  I often do this, then take a shower and repeat the lathering when I get out of the shower, and then shave.<br /><br />I have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don't care that much about fragrance.  MWF doesn't have much of any fragrance.  In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  If you like the smell of MWF (or any other shave soap), keep it in a covered container between uses.  I'd suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered and you'll have a $40 artisanal shave soap!<br /><br />I like the ingredients.  It's tallow based which I prefer.  There's lanolin in it which I like.  Although it's not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn't seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  It doesn't have shea butter in it, so I sometimes keep an open puck of shea butter shave soap in a shave dish next to MWF and occasionally reach down with my brush and lather from both.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews that say that it doesn't lather all that well in &#34;hard&#34; water.  We have moderately hard water in my city and I've never had trouble at all.<br /><br />Finally, it's cheap!  I lather before showering; after showering, and usually a second time while shaving, and my brush is full of lather when I finish and my single puck will last for maybe 300 shaves?? so maybe 4 cents a shave??<br /><br />Also,",True,1,0,1,2

The scrunchies are all decent quality... a nice variety of colors that are displayed accurately in the product photos, good stitching, hidden seams and no holes or flaws in the seams that I can see.

AGQDUP3RR3BYI3S3QO4NT6IDHAMQ,B07KYYLL21,4.0,"It took me over 2 weeks to finalize my purchase of a foot spa from Amazon.  There are so many foot spas and tons of reviews for them all, but we're all looking for the best value here.  I finally pulled the trigger and purchased this model.  Our previous foot spa was purchased from Walmart and had a heater, massage rollers (manual rollers) and bubbles, roughly costing around $60.  So my budget for the next spa would be under $100.  Today was my first day using it (1.5 hour usage:)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Heater:  Works like a champ!  I put relatively hot water into the basin to begin with (Onboard thermometer read 101 degrees.)  I then increased that heat to 105 and it maintained that temp throughout the duration of my use...only slight temp changes to 106 every once in a while, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Shower / Waterfall:  I didn't think anything of this when purchasing it, as I felt it was a gimmick.  It's actually quite soothing and has a purpose here....I used it for probably 75% of the time.<br /><br />Automatic massage rollers:  Holy cow...they are strong, but feel absolutely amazing.  There are 6 separate massage rollers that have several white balls on each that do all the massaging.  The rollers are powered by a motor at the bottom of the unit with the drive shaft come directly up, center of the basin, which is a square shaped metal rod that fits into the bottom of the massage roller plate (which can be removed easily.)<br /><br />Deep basin:  I'm 6'3"", 200 lbs...water completely submerges my feet and ankles and as plenty of room to move my foot back and forth or side to side.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Handle:  There is a handle that folds flush with the unit, but beware....each side of the handle is connected to the basin with 2 small metal screws.  The entire handle and what it's connected to is plastic and doesnt feel secure when the basin is filled with water.  But there is plenty of surface area on the bottom of the unit to easily get ahold of it while moving and the wheels are big enough to set the unit on the floor without squishing your fingers in the process.<br /><br />Bubbles:  Not a con for me, but my wife likes bubbles...So I guess it could be considered a con?  Personal pref, but def not a deterant as this foot spa is great without.<br /><br />Top room / Control panel:  I wear size 12 male shoes...I have to point my feet downwards to enter the basin as the control panel is quite large.  Just as above, this isn't that much of a con as it is really just an ease of use thing.  Once your feet are in the water, you're in Heaven.<br /><br />Considering how much use we got out of our last foot spa, I can see us using this foot spa multiple times throughout each week.  Given that, I'll be sure to update this review as much as possible because I'm quite aware at how difficult it is to purchase a foot spa comfortably without questioning it's worth.",True,1,0,1,2

Being impressed with the packaging was nothing compared to the wonderful aroma that I was treated to when I peeked under the seal and looked at the product. It looked like whipped cream cheese and smelled good enough to eat! The scent is a combination of chocolate and mint. Taking just a tiny bit of the cream in my hands to feel it let me know why it is called velvet body cream. It truly does feel velvety, silky and soft.<br /><br />I was able to appreciate all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is the real treat.

I would say it gives 68 percent flat hair, which is a good result considering the time invested, If you want to look like Hollywood star or the girl in the advertisement of the product, this is not for you, and you will need to go to 30 minutes blow dry and 30'minutes flat ironing if you want flat straight perfect results.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Attractive packaging<br />-It works if you have reasonable expectations<br />- Fast fair to good results<br /><br />Cons<br />- Product looks cheap and chintzy<br />- The brush's bristles are made out of very hard plastic, ouch!<br />- No glove included, although the handle doesn't get hot<br /><br />I am satisfied with the results. Now I can go to work without looking like a mop everyday. Whenever I want my tresses to look flat, I would use my flat iron, but for every day, go and run quick styling, this seem like a good compromise. Hope it lasts as it looks like a cheap price of Chinese rubbish.",True,1,1,1,3

I bought this to give it a shot for us.<br />First you brush your hair (not sure why, but that's what it says), turn this on and it heats up. You brush it through and it straightens your hair. It works better if someone can hold the end of long hair so that the ends get all the way straight. Her hair looked great and smooth. The one disadvantage to it is that the sides of the brush get hot and burned my ear as I was brushing down my hair, like I would use a normal brush.<br />Overall it is a great product and you can use it as a normal brush when it is not on!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review",False,1,1,0,2

AG6S3PFWK5JT3XONUBSJDF3FWVGQ,B003ILUQPM,3.0,"I've had these for almost a year but I haven't used them that much--there are a select few designs that I use regularly, but the majority have remained untouched. Here's why:<br />-A lot of my plates came damaged; maybe I'm just the unlucky one in a thousand, but many had imperfections in the metal that ruined the images. Other than that, the undamaged plates worked decently. You might run the risk of having damaged plates like me, but I'm guessing this was just my bad luck. Can't really blame the company since I never made the effort to return them, and it's been waaay past 30 days (at the time I was just happy I got them).<br />-I liked that there were themed and matching stamps, but to be honest I just don't like a lot of the images enough to actually use them. There is an unnecessary amount of tribal/swirly images, and what were they thinking with the ambiguous pair of chili peppers? Take a good look at the individual images and take that into account more than the sheer number of plates. Will you actually use them?<br />-Unless you have child's hands, the full-nail plates are waay too small--it's most noticeable on the thumbs and middle fingers, but they can barely fit over any of my nails (in terms of width, not length--I don't have crazy-long nails). To avoid awkward-looking nails, I haven't used many of the full nail stamps. Images like the polka-dots are easy to align and restamp, but others not so much.<br />-They come off a little blurrier than Konads, but nothing too horrible<br />-Some of the images are nice in theory, but don't show up that well once stamped. For example, there's a cute lace french tip that I just couldn't get to work because it was impossible to pick up the full image.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />-they're cheap, and most of the images are pretty crisp<br />-A lot of the full-nail designs have matching french tips<br />-The french tips will definitely (probably) fit over all your nails, including thumbs.<br />-I like the themed plates--for example, there's a Christmas one and a Halloween one.<br />-I've heard complaints that these plates were too sharp, but I don't see how you could accidentally hurt yourself with them--maybe they've updated their plate design?<br /><br />Although I haven't used many of the images, those I do use make the bundle worth it. The total price for all 21 image plates--damaged and unattractive though some may be--is the price of 3 Konad stamps. It's definitely worth the price, but I can't guarantee amazing quality.",True,1,1,1,3

AHWPTGX6OD4D46LCQTQVRY4PPHTA,B01D8C3MCE,5.0,"I continue to be sort of amazed at all the cool nail art supplies that keep coming out!! Born Pretty is my favorite Nail Art Brand. I have several Born Pretty items already, and my collection continues to grow! I am so very glad that I found this product!! The set includes 26 different pieces of Nail Shields, that come in 10 different sizes, to shield the skin around your nails and cuticles from nail polish. With all the different sizes included, it is very easy to find the right sizes to fit each of your fingers (my right hand is slightly larger than my left hand, & most people are the same, with one side being just a tiny bit bigger than the opposite side). There is nothing complicated about these at all, you simply slip on each Nail Shield like a ring at the top of your finger tips. Each Nail Shield fits each finger fully and comfortably. The right fit will cover the skin around the nails snugly but also comfortably. After you have found your proper sizes, you can apply your nail polish neatly and precisely, without getting nail polish stains on your skin to clean up after!<br /><br />The directions say to wear the Nail Shields right-side-up, as shown in the pictures (with the curve facing up). This does a fabulous job at shielding the skin around the nail from polish. I find that it also works nicely if you turn them upside-down (with the curve facing down, going from cuticle from nail tip, like the letter U) and then they shield not only the skin around the nail, but the cuticle too!! I still have to make an effort to leave a little space between the cuticle and where the nail polish starts (should be slightly above the cuticle), so using the Nail Shields &#34;upside-down/letter U&#34; also makes a stencil which forces the little gap between cuticle and where polish begins, for a clean, precise, and professional look. (PLEASE SEE MY ATTACHED PHOTOS FOR REFERENCE!)<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, this latest neat and super handy innovation from Born Pretty is also Eco Friendly and Money Saving ++$$!! I have been buying bottles of Liquid Palisade to do the same job, whereas Born Pretty's Nail Shields can be re-used again and again. Palisade can get expensive...  Palisade can also be a real pain to get off, depending on the quality (some are thin in texture and don't come off easily or in one piece). Using tape is even more cumbersome, messy, and inacurate. I'm SO glad I found these!! I was also really fortunate to be able to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. It is a win/win situation, Born Pretty Is my favorite Nail Art Company because I love every item I have ever purchased from them! These Nail Guards will save me a bunch of money over time, and not just from having to purchase more palisade. They are practical, they work well, and I am really happy with my results!

AHWPTGX6OD4D46LCQTQVRY4PPHTA,B01EST7TBQ,5.0,"This is a very nice hair serum that is targeted at encouraging and speeding up hair growth. The first ingredent, and therefore the  most prevalent ingredient, is a type of silicone. Silicone has become the most popular ingredient for anti-friz and shine serums for hair, not to mention a whole world of cosmetics like oil free moisturizers and foundations. It has a slip to it, which gives silicone the *feeling of being like an oil, but it is by its nature, is totally oil free. And of course, also by its nature, it cannot clog pores or follicles. Infact, the Dae Long Hair Growth Serum formula contains three different types of silicone as its first three ingredients. The active ingredients in the product, or the ingredients that actually enable the product to do its job of encouraging hair growth, are Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Lupine Protein, and Panax Ginseng. These nourish and stimulate the hair follicles to remain longer in the anagen, or hair growing phase, and to produce healthier, stronger hair from the root. Jojoba oil is a skin compatible oil, meaning that it cannot and does not clog pores or follicles, closely resembles the body's own natural lubrication, and can be absorbed by human hair, skin, and nails. There is also extract of Macadamia Nut Oil, which moisturizes the hair cuticle and shaft and helps to prevent hair breakage and split ends. Hydrolyzed protein from the seeds of the lupine plant are very high in protein and contain 35-45% of all the essential amino acids. Panax ginseng is an extract from the panax ginger root and has nourishing and stimulating qualities that directly feed and nourish the hair follicle. I was fortunate to be able to order this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have used a great many hair serums and products to stimulate growth of stronger, longer, and healthier hair. One of my favorite things about this Dae Long Hair Growth Serum is that it has a very pleasant fragrance! I also really like that the ingredient list is simple, straightforward, and does not contain weird chemicals or scary preservatives!!! It has a very clean  feel to it, not leaving your hair greasy at the last part that you want to be greasy, the roots. A few drops goes a long way I say five drops will do. While pleasant, It is also important not to over do it!. I have very, very sensitive skin and had no problem at all with this. Time will tell how much it makes the hair grow.

AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B00PM5QEX0,4.0,"Several years ago I had purchased a blowdryer with a similar attachment. I absolutely adored that thing - you could use it on the top of your hair or the sides to give lift so your hair had volume without using any product or doing any backbrushing. The thing was a miracle worker!<br /><br />Then we entered the era of pin straight hair, and volume and body were out. Thank God, we seem to be passing that era, but hairstyling implements seem to be lagging behind. I was dying to try this diffuser to see if it emulated the gizmo from long ago, and it does. Well made hair styling tool that gives lift and volume to your hair, I love it. Well, kinda.<br /><br />I'm not sure how 'universal' this is. I tried it on my current blowdryer, and it didn't fit. I had to go digging around until I finally found a Conair dryer upon which it fit, and the funny thing is that it fit like it was MADE for the dryer. The odd thing is that the Conair looks to have the same kind of nozzle the other blowdryer had, so go figger.<br /><br />IF you have a blowdryer that marries this diffuser well, this is definitely something you're going to want in your hair arsenal. It'd almost be worth getting a new dryer just to use this, it's that good (one star off for the weirdess of the 'universal' claim.)",False,1,1,1,3
AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B0099UG4AM,4.0,"This is going to sound really stupid, but I could never figure out why certain shades of pink lipstick never looked the same on my lips as they did in arm swatches. I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.<br /><br />I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.<br /><br />And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!<br /><br />This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. The only caution I'd say is you don't need to put on as much of this as I did; you'll just be wasting product, and there's no dry down when you overdo it!",True,1,1,1,3
AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B0163GB1NE,5.0,"I'm very big into skincare. Way before I got a Clarisonic, I used scrubbing sponges for daily exfoliation. This facial cleansing pad is a new one to my skincare arsenal. It seems to be a take on various Korean modes of skin cleansing that are currently popular.<br /><br />First off, let me say this sponge is very soft, much softer than anything I've ever used for exfoliating on my face. But while it's soft, it does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without stripping your skin raw. The outer surface feels almost silky, but when you put your fingers in and slightly stretch it to keep it on for use, the stretching opens up the cells in the surface and reveals a very effective, yet gentle, exfoliating mechanism.<br /><br />It's very easy to use, and very easy to clean - it comes with a silken loop to hang it for drying (it dries quickly.) All in all, I like this a lot. It's a nice change from daily Clarisonic use, one my skin truly appreciates.

Several friends had gotten the Boo-Boo concealer in a beauty box, and highly recommended it, so I grabbed it when I saw Amazon had it on sale.<br /><br />I'm very fair, so I got the light version. Ummm, I guess I'm not as fair as I thought; they aren't kidding when they say 'fair'! This is Caspar white!<br /><br />No matter. I mixed a bit of foundation in a more human shade in with the Boo-Boo, and my bruise was history (or at least until I washed my makeup off.) Very nice cover-up, no creasing, no caking, and it didn't move all day. The only issue I had, aside from how light the lightest shade was, is that it did such a good job of covering up the bruise it made the surrounding skin look naked (this is a VERY full coverage item.) Just be aware of that when you buy it.<br /><br />And take them at their word for the color! I'm probably somewhere between light and medium in the Boo-Boo universe. You can always add a drop or two of your foundation to make the color more your shade.",True,1,1,1,3
AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B00WQEJV6M,5.0,"In my younger days, I used to model, so I became an old hand at contouring, which seems to have been revived a la Kim Kardashian. One of my favorite brushes from then was a flat contouring brush that was angled. I absolutely adored it for adding the right shadow under my cheekbones to make them stand out.<br /><br />Since the contouring revival, I decided to give this a go again, but I couldn't find a reasonably priced brush that did what I wanted it to do (I refuse to spend a fortune on a brush for this, mostly because I do not see contouring lasting very long, but that's another review.) The HDSL brush came closest to what I was looking for: dense, flat and with a good handle.<br /><br />It kind of looks like a paint brush, but the hair is VERY nice. Very soft and dense, and a miracle for something that's less than six bucks. My contouring skills are such that I know not to buy an entire palette of colors that are way too orangey or warm. I use Kevyn Aucoin's contour powder which is way pricey (you can find something similar in color in Makeup Forever's eyeshadow line), but the Aucoin contour powder color was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />As I'm sure you know, contour is meant to mimic a shadow. It is NOT a bronzer (you cannot contour with anything with the slightest bit of shine); too orange and you look ridiculous. The color is a light matte taupe with zero hint of red in it. It should NOT be too dark, unless you are dark complected. Think of it as being two shades darker than your skin color, the way a shadow is cast on the hollows or low areas of your face.<br /><br />This brush picked up the powder like a champ and deposited it nicely. Does a great job fading the contour color out so it looks like a shadow and not like I have a swath of dirt on my face. My only hesitation with this so far is that I wish it was angled, but no matter. It's not that hard to use in such a way (well, what do you want for less than six bucks?)<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this. You won't get anything better at anywhere near the price.",True,1,1,1,3
AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B00NT0AR7E,5.0,"I'm totally loving the OZ skin care line, and this retinol serum is an excellent addition! Works very gently but decisively in skimming off dead cells to reveal new, healthy skin. It absorbs quickly and isn't greasy.

AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B005AQC9U8,5.0,"When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.<br /><br />Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.<br /><br />My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.<br /><br />The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)<br /><br />The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.<br /><br />This container isn't.<br /><br />So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.<br /><br />I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)<br /><br />The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.<br /><br />The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.<br /><br />I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.<br /><br />The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.<br /><br />The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.<br /><br />If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.<br /><br />N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)",True,1,1,1,3

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,B09X23VTSQ,3.0,"I have dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin and used this Reboncel Aqua Rich Foaming Cleanser daily for about a week. This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br /><br />After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.",False,1,1,1,3

I don’t know why but I didn’t have high hopes that this Wing Fly Grl Mane Taming Wand gel would be anything special, but it really works great for my fine hair.<br /><br />It’s about the size of a mascara and has a wand with a small foam type applicator (similar to one on a lip gloss) at the end. I just gently run it over the hairs sticking up on top and they just lay down and blend right in with the rest of my hair.  I can’t say how this works for thick hair, but it sure is fast and easy to use and works great for me. My hair is very dark brown and I can’t see any sign of the gel, just the benefit of smooth hair.<br /><br />I haven’t experienced any flaking, dryness, stiffness, wet look, burning or discomfort or issues with my hair color. This wand is convenient as it’s so compact and easy to carry in my purse on-the-go. The ingredient list is short and no ingredients stand out as worrisome health risks or as being possibly damaging to my hair.

I do find this Booster oil a little heavier than some other facial oil blends, but it doesn’t bother me as I tend to use facial oil blends of this type at night, and my skin is dry enough that I can use this during the day. I just have to be careful not to apply too much. When I add a little oil to my cream, I get extra moisture and the oil makes my skin feel soft and look dewy.<br /><br />This Booster has a high percentage of squalane (about 44%). It’s one of my favorite ingredients as it adds extra moisture to my dry skin and makes my skin smooth and soft. For daytime, I do have 100% squalane that I tend to prefer to this Booster oil just because it’s so lightweight yet gives me that extra moisture and softness. But I’d rather use like the the Booster oil blend at night as it has additional ingredients beyond squalane that add benefits, such as antioxidant and fatty acid rich sunflower seed oil.<br /><br />At night, I’ve tried this Booster oil various ways. I’ve applied it after cleansing and toning but would rather use a regular serum. I’ve mixed it with my night cream and have also applied after my cream. I feel there’s no right or wrong way, but I like it best added after my night cream as I can use all my regular products yet I also get an extra boost of antioxidants and moisture that can soak protect and nourish my skin all night. I like waking up to skin that still feels hydrated and comfortable.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this Booster oil emphasizes natural and gentle ingredients, and it also lacks chemical fragrance. I do smell a hint of lavender oil. It can be an irritant form some and can give me headaches if it’s too strong. Luckily, it’s subtle enough not to cause an issue.

I don’t get a white cast from the zinc, but my skin is light. This balm feels like it keeps in moisture and softens my skin.

My dry skin needed something gentle to keep it moist all night and also calm and my usual products felt uncomfortable or just weren’t soothing enough.

I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting 2 or 3 (depending on area). The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I’ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I’ll need to work up. I use the HA serum after use, and it’s a clear gel like serum that’s calming and my redness goes away quickly.

It’s also big enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a lightweight mineral oil based lotion that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. It has a pleasant feel and adds just enough moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly comfortable. I do prefer more hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is moderately strong and sweet.

There’s no fragrance, but this has a nice light scent that hints of citrus.<br /><br />I squeeze out excess solution when I use the pads to remove my eye makeup (concealer, highlighter, shadow, etc.) and the pads do a great job with my eye makeup too. However, I don’t wear waterproof mascara and also don’t rub mascara off my eyes with any remover. My mascara largely comes off when I wash my face, and I’m wed to particular mascara remover that I use to wipe mascara residue after I’ve cleansed. But this works well too.<br /><br />There’s no need to rinse or cleanse after I wipe my face with these pads, and I have skipped cleansing at times. This makes my dry skin feel soft and hydrated and leaves just a hint of residue that I’d guess is glycerin (but I’m not sure). Other times, I basically double cleanse given how I remove my mascara and sometimes I just really want to make sure and remove all residue from my face (especially if I’ve worn more makeup) before applying other products like an essence, serums and creams.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this works so well and also has low risk ingredients. It lacks chemical fragrance, alcohol, silicones and parabens, and it has sodium hyaluronate to hydrate and plump the skin and other dry skin ingredients, such as glycerin, matricaria flower/stem extract and butylene glycol.

It’s rare that I can use all colors in a palette, so I’m really pleased that all three colors work beautifully together and actually flatter my skin tone. The highlighter and even the blush can be used as eye makeup too.<br /><br />I have light skin with an olive hue.

This peach doesn’t have too much orange and is rather neutral, but it gives my skin a natural flush that’s pretty. These colors are buildable, so I start light (especially with the bronzer).<br /><br />These are well pigmented and apply evenly with no streaking. I have dry skin but get a smooth, velvety application. The colors are long lasting as I wore them all day yesterday, and my makeup still looked good at the end of the day. These powders don’t settle in my fine lines, and it’s quick and easy to apply and blend the colors with just one brush. The palette is made in China, but the box says this is certified cruelty free.

I used Glo Pro regularly for about 2-1/2 months, 2-3 times a week. I’m 57 and felt my skin did look particularly good with regular use. While results weren’t dramatic in that my wrinkles didn’t magically disappear, I feel the overall appearance of my skin seemed brighter, firmer and some lines seemed less noticeable. Around my eyes and cheeks aren’t big problem areas (except dark circles), but my fine lines looked virtually nonexistent in those areas and I feel I looked more refreshed and my skin looked more taut. The frown lines by my mouth are my worst issue and those didn’t improve as much as I hoped, but I did think the lines seemed less noticeable and the area seemed less saggy or firmer to me.<br /><br />I decided to take a break of about a month to see if I stopped if I’d notice a difference.  I don’t think my skin looks as good as it did when using Glo Pro regularly. I feel I look less refreshed, my frown lines look worse and my skin seems kind of dull. I can’t speak to the science of whether micro needing really increases collagen production (or if it can damage the skin), or if my benefit is because it increases absorption of my arsenal of serums and creams. But I do think I looked better from use and my skin doesn’t look as good since I stopped. It’s a tool that I’ve gone back to using, and I do really like using a lot.  I apply quality serums and creams within 60 seconds of using Glo Pro and do think I get bigger benefits from my products. I personally avoid using AHA and retinol products after Glo Pro as they’re too irritating for my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I don’t find Glo Pro painful to use. The needles feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused me any excessive redness, irritation or bleeding. I’ve seen videos of bleeding caused by micro needling done by professionals and read that going that deep isn’t required for micro needling to work. I only use Glo Pro at night and never wake with any redness or irritation. I do use the Glo Pro Pads after I cleanse to sanitize in order to avoid bacteria spread as I got a few blemishes after I ran out but don’t get blemishes using the pads (and alcohol is much too harsh for my dry skin).

I definitely prefer using this slimmer eye head for the delicate area around my eyes and between my brows and even my forehead (which is small). The smaller head gives me better control and greater ease of using Glo Pro in small areas.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure of the boundaries around my eye area, so I emailed Glo Pro and was informed the eye head can be used right up to the bottom lashes (but not on the eye lids).

The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).<br /><br />Over the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more 'pulling' instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn't as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn't holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be 'full power' for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was 'expected' for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).<br /><br />I kept using the razor as I wasn't about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.<br /><br />In short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn't a good value for the investment.",False,1,1,1,3

The shampoo itself is OK, but the bottle it's packaged in is designed to keep you from actually getting what you paid for. I'll explain.<br /><br />The curved shape of the bottle itself probably makes it very efficient to pack/ship, but it also makes it difficult to squeeze, especially in combination with the thick, rigid plastic they use. And because the ""nozzle"" (or whatever it's called) is offset rather than centered, you cannot balance it upside-down to make it easier to get the remaining shampoo out as the bottle gets low. The combination of these three factors (rigid plastic, thin curved shape, and offset ""nozzle"") means that at a certain point, you're going to have shampoo left in the bottle that you can't actually get out, unless you want to rig some kind of device to balance the bottle upside-down.<br /><br />This may seem like a minor complaint, but with basically ANY other brand of shampoo (or body wash, EMJ does this with those as well), you don't have to deal with this. It's wasteful, and it feels like it was probably designed that way on purpose, to get consumers to buy the next bottle faster.

AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ,B08R6QX4Y9,4.0,"I've been using extensions since 2006, due to health issues causing extreme hair thinning.  I used to get the fused extensions at the salon, 1500 dollars back in the day. They broke off from the weight of the extensions because my hair was so fine and thin. The fused glob of hair was just too much and so many fell out. I started buying the clip in hair, taking the clips off and using them as weft hair. I use salon pro white glue, much like eyelash glue but used for weft hair.  It is a wonderful solution and I still alternate between tape in hair and the clip in wefts. I also buy closures and custom color, to make my own toppers. What a job! But, I'm happy with the results. I have more control over the color and style, and I feel 'normal'.<br /><br />This hair is a medium to coarse texture, thick, and has a really nice body wave. The  is soft and smooth and doesn't feel damaged.  It will blend with fine hair. You can use a straightening iron, just be sure that you can control the temperature. Once you burn this hair, it will stink and it will be ruined. However, if you control the temperature and use care, the hair looks great straight and shiny. You can also curl the hair. I have used felted hot rollers, and those work really well. They are safer, and not as damaging, and the curls last so long.<br /><br />These 16"" extensions are very nice. Although the ad isn't quite accurate. The color is a darker caramel blond, and a reddish brown. This is not piano keys, but close. The wefts are not in the ombre style, they are bold and varied high lights. If you look at the ad images, the photos showing the people aren't shown with this product in their hair. The wefts laying on a surface showing the color differences between the offered colors is the most accurate.  I've offered some images that show the color more accurately.  You can custom color most of the wefted hair, but adding color is easier. Typically the hair has so much red in it that it is impossible to cover or remove, and the dye can be hard to remove. You can add a longer root to eliminate the chunky roots.  My hair is so fine, the sewn edge can be obvious, so have a good match to my natural blonde ash tone roots helps. Any coloring will add to the damage and potentially shorten the life of the hair, but for me it makes me happier to have an exact match to what I want, and I am hard to match for color.<br /><br />The weight of the hair is shown in a photo in ounces. In grams, we get a little over 104 grams, far less than the advertised 120grams, and I would complain about this and have, just not for this brand.  That being said, the fullness and the weight is still good, and the wefts seem to feel average when compared to what I usually order. If you order the longer options, the hair will be thinner, as most hair is sold by weight. 120 would be better, of course. This weight is significantly lower than 120grams.<br /><br />Shedding.  Over the last 7 years or so, shedding has become a real problem. It never used to be this bad. There is a weft glue that is meant to slow or prevent shedding and I always use it. It makes the weft more stiff, but if you use the weft the way I use them, you need to do something to protect your weft hair.  You can find it online. If you are using this hair for special occasions and clipping  to thick strong hair and are simply making your hair more full, wild and glamorous, then you may not need to worry about shedding. I did finger comb this hair once out of the packaging, and there was significant shedding. Again, I say, this is a common issue now, and unique to this particular brand. I have no idea what changed but the wefts should not shed this much, but they all do this with most brands.  I have to say that if the wefts didn't shed so much, they would last for a couple of years or longer.  Also, keep in mind I use the wefts differently, so clipping, as intended, may offer longer life and far less shedding.<br /><br />The length is 16"" and the hair hangs nicely, with a gentle, natural taper.  There is a very nice body wave. It's not a blunt edge finish, which is nice.<br /><br />The clips are the same type that I see on most clip in kits. They are small, and hold nicely even on fine hair.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great value and will require the extra effort to keep them looking great over a year or more.  To keep human hair looking good and tangle free, I use the sleep and shine shampoo and conditioner. It keeps the hair fresher and mat free longer.

When I order next I'll be ordering the shorter hair.  The weight of the hair for 20 pieces, is 50grams, so for each longer strand you have a finer tape in weft. With the shorter lengths you get a little more fullness in other words but typically the good brands still make sure they are clear about the weight of the hair you get in grams. My hair is so fine that one bundle of 20 nearly is enough, but I buy 2 sets and end up using 4 rows of about 6 extensions each then complete the look with a topper because my crown is so thin the extensions and scalp shows. I'll be toning these extensions but this is how they look as they came, with no color correction. B 8-18-60. Which is usually the color I order, but this is better. This color matches my hair better than the brand I have been using.<br /><br />I do a single weft application using a single sided tape to finish the back side of the weft and seal the tape. You must seal the backside of the tape or the weft will fall out, or make a mess of your hair. Many people need 4 or more sets to do a full head of hair. Some people with thicker and stronger hair will use two full wefts back to back and will not need the single sided tape. There are you tube videos about DIY application of tape in extensions. There are many steps and I'm skipping most of it. It's not that hard and you'll enjoy the convenience and savings by doing this yourself. Your biggest challenge is finding good hair and good tapes. This time used Glam single sided tapes and that worked great. expensive but good and you get 36 in the package. I use walker double sided tapes, they come in packages of 120 and have worked for me but they are stiff. This brand has tapes, and I'll be checking out their tapes soon.  I will have to update to let you know how they last and how easy or difficult they are to remove. Typically my tape in hair lasts about 6 weeks and then due to growth there is a need to take them out and put them back in again, moving them up closer to the scalp. 6 to 8 weeks is typically when you go to the salon to get cut and root touch ups too. This isn't really about hold or the extensions coming out, although some may come out. This is about limiting damage to the hair and just keeping the connection point closer to the scalp. They feel good, the hair quality seems great. There is far less red in this hair than typical of the dark blonds or ash blond roots.  This color combination is good. The description says silky straight but I prefer some body wave, and as you can see when you wet this hair there is a little natural wave that comes out. That's perfect. I've offered plenty of photos. The kit that the hair came with is nice too. Some double sided tapes to refresh your weft after you clean them in 6 weeks or so.  To remove the wefts I typically just stick my finger nail between the two layers of tape and put a drop or two with a dropper of alcohol 91 percent will work but 99 is better. This usually works to safely loosen the glue bond and remove the hair. I tried the oil based removers and it just complicates things. The best removers are mostly alcohol.

My husband can't stand hair on his neck so it cleans it up very well.  If you plan to use this to give yourself a haircut, your hair will be very short when done.  It has clips but they aren't for longer hair.  My best friend cuts his own hair but his is longer and he uses a kit that has more clip sizes with it.  If you are concerned you might not know how to use this well, get online and watch videos.  There are so many that will tell you exactly how to do it and how to use clippers.  If you keep your hair very short, this is good to use so you don't have to go back to the barber too quickly and can keep a big haircut at bay.  Look at the width of the head and make sure that suits you.  That was something I hadn't considered until I started using this.  I think it would be easier to maneuver for the beard if it were just a little narrower.  However, with the size it is you can cover more area much more quickly, with fewer passes.  It removes the hair very well with just one pass.  It doesn't come with oil but it is recommended you oil this as needed.  It comes with a cable for charging.  Because it is cordless, I can use it anywhere and that is very convenient.  The clips go one easy and can be a little harder to get off.

The beauty lays in the eye catching design and craftsmanship found in the shaver, the flaw--unfortunately--is in it's primary purpose, which is, as a shaver. As it turns out, I've owned two other Norelcos and a mid-range Braun which have proven to be dependable, well made and produce a good, clean shave. The Norelco arcitec 1050, while doing reasonably well at the job of cleaning the scruff off one's mug, seems to require more passes to do the same thing the older models managed with one. The trimmer is also different. The idea is that you must pop off the razor head to get use of it. A novel idea I suppose, but I cannot say that it is any better or worse than the trimmer on my old Norelcos, though it is narrower. Want to buy an Norelco arcitec? Then the 1050 is absolutely the model you should get as the much pricier 1090 is identical in every respect except that the LED array includes a battery charge countdown(which ironically draws power), providing you a ballpark idea of when you'll run out of juice. This shaver is still a little expensive (mine happened to be a gift), but it is well made and should provide years of service.

Received confirmation and updates about the shipping.<br />The hair is AMAZING!!!! A perfect match with a frontal from a different vendor. (Ordered frontal before buying this hair) I've washed this hair several times and let it air dry. The wave pattern always bounces back. This hair can be styled many ways. I've had it flat ironed, barrel curl, wand curl, and spiral rod curls. This hair holds curls very well and after a few days, the curls open and fall so natural. After having it installed as a sew in for 2 weeks, I took it out and made a wig. This is much more conveinent for maintenance. Hair is still beautiful and going strong. I haven't experienced shedding because I did not cut the wefts, nor did I sew through them. This is the best hair I have received in comparison with expensive brands that I've used in the past. I also take good care of the hair and wrap it up at night when it is installed.<br />A bonus is receiving eyelashes, although I don't wear them.

I like to wear old bathing suits this way to work around the yard and in my garden, with a pair of shorts over them.

Not too much hair, but not thin or flimsy. Has two combs at the top in front to secure wig, and the adjustable latches at the neck. I was prepared to love it forever and buy ten more. However:<br />The not so good and the bad: the color is flat black, there is no natural color variation and looks like a poor dye job, the ear tabs did not align with my actual ears, and so poked out to the sides a bit. The hair line would not lay flat to my head, and when I tried to pull some of the front strands to the side to keep them out of my eyes, I saw that the seams are thick and obvious. Since it has a bit of lace at the top I figured to reset the part, but there is a seam in the middle of the lace, so parting it<br />in any other location within the lace area literally shows a fat black seam.<br /><br />Now, I am not a wig expert.

AFBUEKUYLGIQMA2XC26CXYIHNIFA,B000G8LWZI,5.0,"I have adult onset acne. I have had it for over a decade. Nothing would cure it. Benzyl peroxide makes me break out worse and rash up. >2% salicylic acid spot treatment products help, but nothing really evened everything out and made the acne start to go away. I wouldn't say this is a miracle, but it certainly is the only thing that I have found in the past 10 years that works (and yes I have seen 3 dermatologists for this issue with no permanent resolution).<br /><br />The Routine:<br />I apply this glycolic product 1x at night and a light face moisturizer 1x in the morning (plus an eye cream when I remember). I started seeing immediate results within less than 2 weeks. I also, after reading so many scarey reviews about negative product interactions, am happy to report that I had NO additional breakouts with the product and only light tingling for the first few minutes of application. I would compare this tingling to the feeling you get just after applying a witch hazel cotton pad (for those with pain concerns regarding the 'tingle' reported by others).<br /><br />Regarding Results 2 Weeks In:<br />For those of us that have had long term acne and know how good we look in summertime (due to the sun hiding your acne spots) this is how I feel now, two weeks later, when I see myself in the mirror. I don't know how well it will treat these recesses (old acne scars) I have in my cheek area, but the red splotches are gone and skin tone has evened substantially.<br /><br />I also should be honest and say that the use of a glycolic product was recommended to me from my identical twin sister (yay for matching DNA and two people trying to solve the same problem at once). Anyways, she used a similar AHA product for a year (not this one exactly). However, her acne, red splotches, break outs, and scars are completely gone after 1 year of use of an AHA glycolic product. After seeing her results I thought I would find a similar product to try. (keeping fingers crossed over this year!)<br /><br />Opinion Section:<br />I saw a number of negative reviews. In reflection, I would suspect that sensitive youth skin may not benefit as much from this product as adult skin. I noticed that the product is far less drying on my face than advertised by others. Heck, I don't even bother to moisturize at night and have no ill over-drying effects. However, I worry that if you are purchasing the product for 'oil control' or have much oil production on your face this may aggravate your acne situation. I only comment this because when I get up in the morning I can still feel this product on my face - it's not greasy or oily, I just feel a sheen. This could explain some of the negative posters comments. In my experience, I think youth acne needs drying more than adult acne, which needs exfoliation. If you are in your mid 20s and up (and DO NOT have sensitive, oil - prone, raging hormone youth skin), then this product is relatively inexpensive and delivers!<br /><br />PS: If there is a youth out there that has the opposite of this experience, please flag this (if this review section will allow it) to remove this last paragraph for accuracy as i do not want my speculation to mislead people on a product that is in my opinion, from first hand experience, absolutely wonderful.",False,1,0,1,2

AF2ACCKOTUKHIGCZHGHSZXMJDTKQ,B000UK2VRK,4.0,"I've been using Norelco shavers since I began shaving.  I briefly tried both another brand and bladed shaving, and didn't like either.  I tried this out as a replacement to my 8140XL.<br /><br />As with most electric shavers on the market, you get convenience, simple charging, savings on consumable blades and cream, and a nice little gadget for your bathroom with this shaver.  A blade always wins on optimum closeness, but takes longer and is more ""dangerous"" to those of us with a not so fine touch.  Those aside, there were a few things that I liked, and a few things that bugged me about this specific shaver.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Lightweight<br />Wow, this shaver is really light and easy to handle when shaving, especially tougher areas that require holding the shaver upright at times.<br /><br />-Waterproof<br />The fact that you couldn't get in contact with water or even in a shower used to be a huge disadvantage to electric razors.  This unit is fully waterproof, which also makes it easier to clean.<br /><br />-Uses Li-ion batteries instead of NiCad<br />One of the things that irked me about the last razor I bought was that it still contained a ridiculously obsolete NiCad battery.  NiCad cells suffer from the ""memory effect"", which means they can hold a smaller and smaller amount of charge over time.  This shaver has Li-Ion, the best kind of battery available, with no memory effect.  This means it will continue to hold the same charge for years to come.<br /><br />-Cool Charger base<br />This is a lot cooler looking, and takes up less space on the countertop than just plugging into the wall and laying the shaver sideways to charge.  It also keeps track of the cord.<br /><br />-Flex Tracker System<br />The head conforms to whatever surface I'm shaving pretty well, and just looks cool.<br /><br />Cons: (these won't apply to everyone, and are my opinion only)<br /><br />-Built in lotion dispenser<br />I've never wanted this feature.  It's simply another way for them to continue to charge for refills of the product, when part of the reason for having an electric razor is so you don't have to keep paying for blades!

You don't need this goop to use the shaver, so I would skip it.<br /><br />-Not as speedy as older models<br />This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  It's not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not slower.<br /><br />-40 minutes of charge time<br />This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this shaver, it has some great features you'll probably enjoy.  You might want to be aware of the cons I've noted, and keep in mind you can follow up on Norelco's guarantee if you're not happy with your individual shave.",False,1,1,1,3

I'm an adult and bought these for myself — I like to wear a small flower or pretty barrette on the side of my hair most days. These clips are very ethereal, with a delicate fluttering effect while wearing. They have beautiful detail on the wings, and sparkly bodies that thankfully do not shed glitter. The metal clips are covered in grosgrain ribbon, which is more comfortable and makes them look extra polished.<br /><br />The only downside is that these clips need better packaging. Mine arrived completely strewn about inside the bubble mailer — their flimsy plastic bag had busted open during shipping — and several butterfly wings were bent askance. The wings are, I'm guessing, a polyester satin fabric (not feathers or nylon stockings with wire), so I used my iron on low heat to straighten out the bent wings. It worked perfectly.",False,1,1,0,2

I've sprinkled a bit on my body pillow, too, when I feel like I want a much stronger dose of the relaxation.<br /><br />I read somewhere that mixing it with a carrier oil (I'm using rosehip oil) and rubbing it on the bottom of your feet can help with insomnia, so I've been doing that.

In my opinion Inverness makes the best quality piercing earrings on the planet. Besides the birthstone piercing earrings, I have a number of other designs as well, and a couple of months my daughter had her ears pierced with the October Rose color flower earrings, which are perfect for a 6 year-old's first pair of pierced earrings. She now also has a pair of Inverness Rainbow Flower earrings as well which she switched to after her Rose ones had been in for over 6 weeks.<br />When it came time to pierce my daughter's ears, I would not have trusted them to any other piercing system than Inverness, as not only are their earrings second to none when it comes to quality, but the same can be said for their piercing system & piercing instruments. My daughter actually smiled throughout the piercing.<br /><br />Now, about the earrings - These Inverness Piercing Earrings, such as the 3mm Birthstone Post Earrings are extremely well-made with the strong posts that are honed to a sharp surgical point which not only adds to the ease of the piercing, but they are covered in the ear the Inverness Patented Safety Clutch, which is sort of a bell-shaped earring back, that safely covers the point of the post end and cannot by easily removed by little hands.<br /><br />As an adult who at this point has no need to continue to wear piercing earrings, I actually prefer to wear many styles of Inverness Piercing Earrings, and the birthstones are some of my very favorites.

Although this is a permanent fixture on our sink, it could easily travel with us if we went anywhere. Being a compact, travel-friendly water flosser I was surprised at how much volume it can hold. If you can't tell, I'm really impressed by the compact ability of this water flosser.<br /><br />It comes with a variety of tips, enough to make this usable for a couple as my husband and I share it. It is very easy to use, the one call out if you have a more traditional water flosser is that this is a rechargeable unit! It comes with a charging cord (USB), but no base -- so you'll have to grab one of your existing ones and let this charge for about 8 hours -- so you can't use it straight out of the box.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that even at maximum pressure it is not as strong as our previous one.

I use this for the days that I wear makeup, it is not a product that I use daily. If I wear anything more than brow filler, then I use this. It's the first step in my routine when I wear make up, as it works well to remove the light foundation and concealer that I use. I use a pump or two and massage it into my face and then rinse with water -- this doesn't lather like washes do, but it works. I does a great job at removing face makeup -- however, I stick to eye makeup remover or micellar water if I wear any eye makeup.<br /><br />Overall this is great for removing makeup. It by no means replaces a face wash, but it's a great pre-step when you have worn makeup during the day. I tried it on a fuller face of makeup and it works wonderfully as well.

AE6TDCUOKCSCRL5ZHWKEL7QHOA3A,B00JMDPK8S,3.0,"Update:  I am lowering my rating to 3 stars because of the difficulty and expense of finding and buying replacement heads.  I couldn't find any for quite some time.  I've since found some online, not on Amazon, but from a low of $19.99 (but out of stock) to more than $25 for a single head.  The difficulty and cost makes buying this brush too impractical, which is too bad because I like the unit.<br />~~~~~~~<br /><br />The toothbrush I reviewed is the similar model, EW-DE92.  I was taken to this page when I tried to post my review.<br /><br />First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the ""white"" mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner's guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.<br /><br />I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use ""white"" most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don't use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn't feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.<br /><br />Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.<br /><br />The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.<br /><br />But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to ""Contact an authorized service center for repair.""  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.<br /><br />One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don't like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.<br /><br />While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don't believe the price difference is justified.",False,1,1,1,3

As an Aesthetic RN (Yeah, that's right, Botox, Fillers... painful Machines both large and small ;-) I fancy myself to have a healthy skepticism about the latest fads in health, beauty, and 'De-age-ification'. A girlfriend of mine REALLY wanted me to buy this Rose Quartz Roller. She gave me lots of reasons about lifting and tightening which fell on deaf ears. But then she mentioned Lymphatic Drainage. That got my attention. There is a snippet of good research to support lymphatic drainage as a valid de-age-ification tool. Not enough to get me to buy this thing. But, the research exists.<br /> The reason I bought the Rose Quartz Roller is because I have ALLERGIES. When I was a child in the Midwest, I was allergic to the month of June. Now, I live on the Left Coast and my “hayfever” is 365/24/7. I take daily antihistamines, I pop an additional Mucinex and 12 hour pseudoephedrine to clear out my head weekly. When it gets really bad, I end up on my back, on my bed, drugged up, hot steam going, and massaging my face to aid my lymphatic drainage. This process helps. I can usually get things cleared up enough to breath through my nose and get to sleep.<br /> NOW, I have this handy little tool. When I have a few extra moments in the morning or evening I quickly run it in counts of 10 strokes over my lymphatic pathways. I either work from the chin up or from my eyes up then my cheeks down. Always sweeping from the center outward, I was taught to work the pathways of the face all the way down the outside of the neck, to the clavicles. With this roller, it takes me very little time. I can feel the motion of all the annoying stuff in my sinuses as it clears. The small roller end is great for the eyes and upper face and the larger end simplifies the lower face and neck. The Rose Quartz Roller changes lymphatic massage from something I would take the time for when I absolutely had to do it, to a fun and easy once or twice a day part of my self care routine.

This is on par with what I pay for my other serums, if not actually a little cheaper.  I was able to try it in the sample pack - DO IT THERE FIRST!!  This sadly will not be a serum for everyone.  I have really, really, really dry skin.  Just genetics.  I also work outside and play outside year round so my skin is abused.  I need very heavy moisturizers.  If you have oily skin, or even mixed, this may not work for you, or it would be best used as a once a week quench.  It takes some tinkering to find out the right amount to put on.

I hadn't known I could simply *install* dreads without having to grow my own hair long and then proceed to do whatever magic (and damage) was necessary to create dreads. As soon the first set of 12 arrived, I was thrilled; I also knew that 12 strands was nowhere near enough to cover my head so I ordered a second set. Each set came with a bag of random hair accessories as well as what looks similar to a crochet hook. The hook is ridiculously small, so I don't know if it's intended to pull the hair through the top loop or if it's to help maintain the dreads as they're washed and loosen up over time. There were no instructions, so after my first set arrived I scoured the Internet to find photos of loc styles as well as tutorials about how to install them. I've included a short video with this review to help people realize that the most difficult part will be installing these on the back of your head.

I don't plan to have my entire head in dreads, but if I did I could easily get away with only 3 to 4 sets (with leftovers) because my hair is really thin and I'd pull larger sections through the top loop as I braided each piece in.<br /><br />The ends of the dreads look a little scraggly BUT I think that makes them look all the more authentic; in fact, I was surprised when I hopped back online and saw these are synthetic! The top of each has a black rubber band just below a loop of hair and you basically pull a section of your own hair through that top loop, split that hair into two sections (so with the dread and your own hair you have three separate sections). Get the dread close to your scalp, then simply braid the three sections together to secure the loc into place. You'll need a small rubber band to hold the sections together where they end and it's that simple! You can attach the little hair accessories wherever you choose.<br /><br />If you've been wanting locs, these are an excellent value and the perfect way to see if the look is right for you.

I was able to easily pluck my eyebrow hairs to perfection. I am not a person that is ever precise enough to use the pointed tweezers, but since they came in this set, I put them to use in a different way. I am using them to weed my vinyl designs after I cut them. They are precise and working out nicely. I also tried the flat pair, which work fine, but I really prefer the slanted overall for my uses. These come in a sparkly purple case. The tweezers are color coded with a shimmery glittery finish.

The inverter is small and compact but still manages to provide you with enough power to be able to charge up most devices such as a laptop, as well as mobile devices like phones and tablets.

The tattoos are all supposedly inspired by what celebrities have, however there is none that I can recognize, but I'm sure they are correct. To apply the tattoo of your choice, just look for the one you want, cut it out from one of the sheets, peel off the clear plastic and then place it face down on the body part where you want the tattoo. Next, use a washcloth that is wet and place it over the tattoo for 20-30 seconds and you can now peel back the paper and you will notice that it has transferred perfectly. I've tried a lot of the ones I received and they all went on without any issues or with any only partially transferring like I've experienced with other temporary tattoos in the past.

So I started scouring the internet for a solution and found these shower bombs! They smell so good... EVERY scent. My almost 2 year old loves grabbing one every time we shower (she now expects one lol.) They fizz up if directly under the water or very slowly melt if not directly in water. The first one we used I followed the directions and kept it out of the direct water. This bomb lasted at least 3 15 minute showers so a good 45 minutes. This brings me to my only complaint. They are very fragrant but for some reason when in the shower out of the direct water I couldn’t really smell it. Our shower is fairly big along with our bathroom and we only have a shower curtain on it. I’m guessing the smell would be more powerful in a smaller bathroom. After the first shower not smelling as powerful as I would like I tried playing with the bomb. I put it directly in the shower (lasted about 15 minutes.) Tried close to the water but not directly in it. None of these really helped with the power of the scent. For the price and the fact that they last so long I will be reordering them as we are almost out and the toddler will be upset if she doesn’t have her shower bomb. We do put them right over the drain now which does seem to help a little with the smell.,True,1,0,1,2

It is adjustable with nice combs to help secure the wig.

I’ve had to stop wearing cosmetics, and my skin routine has felt like a part time job. I also have several allergies, and the antihistamines I have to take make my skin/lips even more dry. I’ve apparently become overly sensitized to ingredients in 95%+ of commercial lip balm products, “natural” ingredients/products. No matter how much water I drink, very healthy diet, hyaluronic acid supplements & topical hyaluronic acid + occlusives, running a humidifier, staying indoors, etc., nothing has helped the severe, painful peeling of my lips for the past 3-4 years. It’s been embarrassing and has made talking, eating and drinking an uncomfortable and painful.<br /><br />Everything I tried seemed to make this even worse, so I eventually gave up on lip balm. I tried “nothing,” (just to see if I actually needed lip balm- that was a mistake!). I resorted to trying single ingredient options, just to help identify what the problem ingredient might be: testing by applying only straight argan, olive, safflower or squalane oils (messy, shiny, and doesn’t last without an occlusive layer added on top), straight manuka honey (messy, sticky, expensive and only made me want to lick my lips all day lol). Made my own manuka honey, argan oil and beeswax product (worked pretty well but oh so messy, time consuming to make).<br /><br />Finally gave up on that and was only able to use Vanicream ointment (dermatologist recommended and similar to Vaseline but without the petrochemical odor- I can’t use products like Vaseline or Aquaphor FWIW). But even that wasn’t working well because i needed to be SO careful not to apply too much, or the ointment would eventually  migrate onto my face (usually while sleeping), which would cause rosacea flares (heavy occlusives seal in moisture but can also trap in just enough heat to cause a rosacea flare).<br /><br />But that messy solution that only stopped **some** of the peeling temporarily, and never resolved the issue entirely. Even applying every hour on the hour didn’t make much of a difference. My lips were still chapped feeling/peeling every day, just slightly less chapped.<br /><br />But THIS STUFF IS WHAT ALL LIP BALMS ARE MEANT TO BE! I am not exaggerating when I say that within an hour or so after applying this for the first time, I noticed my lips didn’t feel rough any longer… for the first time in YEARS!!! Weird, right?!! I didn’t believe it could be possible at first, but it’s truly  like I’ve never had chapped, peeling lips. Miracle in a tube!<br /><br />This must be what Goldilocks looks for when her lips are chapped: It doesn’t burn. It doesn’t sting. It doesn’t taste weird. It’s not too shiny or greasy feeling. It just makes my lips feel smooth and soft. You can faintly taste the elderberry/manuka honey when applying but it doesn’t linger. It’s not overpowering or flavorful enough to make you inadvertently lick your lips, which I always seem to do with “yummy” lip balm products.<br /><br />It just works. My grad school student son also loves it for the same reasons. It just makes your lips feel and look like lips are supposed to feel and look like.

If the wave doesn't have product, it isn't tame. So, most mornings I dry/straighten it to avoid looking like a wild banshee at work.<br />However, I recently moved to Florida and because of the humidity, my waves are being a bit more cooperative. That being said, a product like this that would help hold the wave throughout the day and tame the &#34;wildness&#34; is desirable. Unfortunately, this has not worked for me as it is advertised.<br />There isn't enough salt to hold the hair in place. Instead of a subtle stiffness to hold the 'beach wave', my hair appeared a droopy, greasy mess that looks like I'd slept in a frying pan (with leftover bacon grease) rather than the just-off-the-surf look that I was anticipating.<br />Everyone's hair is different, so perhaps this product works better for others. My hair is long and thick. I would think that this may work better for people with shorter hair where gravity isn't fighting with the product all day.<br />Okay, so why did I give this more than one star? IT SMELLS AMAZING!

Now that I can no longer find it, I decided to try the Shape Tape Matte Formula in shade 29B.<br /><br />I see from other reviews that the Matte Formula can be very drying, settling into pores, wrinkles and lines.  When I wore it, it felt like it literally sucked the moisture right out if my facial skin, leaving it almost painfully dry!!!<br /><br />I have discovered a way to sidestep that and make this look and feel just as nice as the Hydrating Formula.  Under my moisturizer, I apply a thin layer of Argan Oil. Then after a couple of minutes I apply my moisturizer. Then I apply ""Tarte Base Tape PRIMER.""

The brush head seems to be the same size and consistency of my other two brushes.  The handle is a little shorter than one (same length as the other) and narrower/thinner than the handle on both my other brushes.  Not horrible but just a little smaller than I was used to.  The first couple times I used the brush it did shed maybe 5-6 bristles each time. But that number dropped off drastically and after a couple weeks of use it might loose a bristle every second or third use.<br />One thing I was happy about was that the complete brush not seems well seated/anchored in the handle.  Every other brush i have bought the whole brush head loosened almost immediately and within a couple weeks came out. So i'd have to break out the Gorilla Glue and repair.  But this brush seems solid.<br />The brush works up a decent lather although it is not as easy or as voluminous a lather as my favorite brush and i'm not sure why.  The brushes seem very similar.  My best guess is the Beau Brummell doesn't seem to retain moisture as well as my other brush.<br />All in all it is a good brush and a great brush for the price.<br />Please note that I received this brush at about an 85% discount with the stipulation that I write a review.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 19, 2015:  So its now been about two months of using this brush about 3-5 times per week.

That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It’s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it’s wet and soapy.

But then it absorbs well and leaves my skin a bit tighter and smoother. One reviewer has perfectly described the effect as akin to putting on pantyhose -- everything just feels held together nicely.<br /><br />I can't honestly say I will re-order this, because I use a pore refiner that does a better job of leaving my face makeup-ready, and Vitamin C serum seems to leave my skin clearer and nicer.

So, this product will work for some people. It just doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />This product is not overly expensive, which helps, but there are a number of lower-priced moisturizers that I believe most people would find just as good as (or perhaps better than) this one.

And it does!<br /><br />I have used at least a half-dozen foundation primers over the years. I find that they not only help with foundation application, they also help foundation look better and last longer. For a couple of years now, I've used Avon's Magix Face Perfector, which is a reasonably priced, fine product. Having now used Eclipse Foundation Primer, though, I have a new favorite.<br /><br />For starters, this product goes on and absorbs into the skin with amazing ease. It comes out of the container in a semi-solid state and then just melts as I rub it into the skin. After letting it sink in for a minute (it doesn't take long), I'm ready to apply foundation, which then goes on smoothly and evenly. Applied over this primer, my foundation is more consistently even, which looks very nice. And with the foundation being smoother on the face, my blusher and powder apply more smoothly and evenly, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the Eclipse primer is the way it helps me go without foundation altogether! It makes my skin feel and appear so silky, I can just apply a bit of blusher and I'm ready to go. Since I'm 63, that's saying something!<br /><br />The Amazon product description refers to the primer as a &#34;powdery gel&#34; -- and that's a perfect description. It feels really good on my skin and makes my skin look better regardless of whether I follow it with foundation, just powder or blusher, or nothing else at all.<br /><br />The price of this foundation primer seems a bit high until it becomes apparent how long it lasts. It doesn't take much to cover the face; a little goes a long way. Plus, if you go to the Global Care Essentials website, you'll see that it's substantially higher there than on Amazon!<br /><br />My experience with this product has been thoroughly delightful, and I'm very glad to have found it.

AEKWD5653VPVL7PHTDABCF5V7JCQ,B014DH4FTC,5.0,"Next on the Valentia beauty line, comes the True Glow Eye Cream for review. I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!<br /><br />Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:<br /><br />Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles<br />Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes<br />Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.<br />Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.<br /><br />Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia.

It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.<br /><br />Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!<br /><br />I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!<br /><br />Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.<br /><br />Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonal allergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Oz Naturals.

You get a boost from:<br /><br />Caffeine- Derived from green tea, which provides you with instant firming and lifting results<br />Retinol- allows the skin to resurface at a quicker pace, lessening the appearance of the cellulite/dimples<br />Cocoa Butter- softens and also helps keep the skin looking beautiful<br />Shea Butter- allows the “newer” skin to get a healthy amount of nutrients and moisture<br />Vitamin C- helps your skin hold more moisture and gives it a healthy glow (brightens)<br />Vitamin B5- helps to keep skin soft and healthy, but also provides a smoother look<br />All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested<br /><br />Application- The product works best when applied twice a day, just like a facial skincare regimen. You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.<br /><br />What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I’m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural’s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the “turn-over” process of shedding our “damaged” looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin’s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.

I recommend coal tar shampoo to all my patients. Most dandruff shampoos use salicylic acid (which is aspirin) for the itching, which is NOT very good at stopping the itch.

It's available in higher strengths by prescription, but this product at 2.5% is sufficient for most scalps.<br /><br />Just use it 3x/week for adequate control. Let it sit in the scalp for five minutes, which means apply immediately upon entering the shower, then do your stuff. Just before exiting, wash it out. It's okay to leave some in the scalp; it won't hurt you. You may wish to use shampoo after, but this has shampoo/conditioner in it and in my experience, using other hair products is counterproductive.<br /><br />This tingles, so you know it's working. The only problem? It's nearly impossible to find in stores, and is often sold out at Amazon. Other companies make similar products. Just type COAL TAR SHAMPOO in the search bar to find others. They all have 2.5-3% coal tar. You need a script for 5% for some idiotic reason. What, you're going to get addicted to the stuff and overdose?

Just make sure to wipe the brush a few time on a napkin before using to wipe off the acetone.<br /><br />After I've removed the old nail polish, I wipe my nail clean with either an alcohol pad or some acetone. I then cut an appropriate piece of the fiberglass to cover the break.  I apply the fiberglass to the clean nail & I apply a thin line of this gel over the patch, then I take my handy, dandy nail polish brush & I spread out a thin layer of the gel over the entire nail, same as if I was applying nail polish.

AFHXYI2Y5ZTAGDIRS6IHLFPR2SRA,B001LBFC6E,3.0,"I LOVE the blush stick.  I used to get a nice product from Coty back in the 60's and 70's and have been looking for it ever since they stopped making it, and I don't know why, because it was my FAVORITE thing.  The blush stick, mascara (I have very light red lashes that don't show up), eyeliner, and a little Maybelline eyeshadow - I had the blues pallette and a green one.  That is all I needed daily, plus a medicated makeup in a tube with a tiny tip to spot cover any blemishes.  Clean face with Neutrogena soap and that was it.  Coty Blush stick was much larger than this one, and almost exactly the same consistency and color as the Pink Lemonade. It cost only $6 for the nice 4 inch pink twist-up tube. As I said before I LOVE the product.  The reason I took away two stars is that you get so much packaging and so little actual blush stick.  It is about 3/4 inch in diameter and less than a half inch stick height.  You would think you are getting about two inches in the twist-up container, but NO, they fool you.  It is a tiny portion, and if you use it daily as I used to do, this will last less than a month per stick.",False,1,1,1,3

AHLNQ6K4TUYBIV7EASDMZCGIIBFQ,B004RGOESC,4.0,"This is a large UV-protected BPA-free plastic bottle. I've been slathering it all over myself to see what effect it had topically. I personally like the smell-it's a soft wheaty-flaxy-earthy smell. It smells like something real which is what it is; nothing else but the real cold-pressed oil. I also like the taste which is similar to the smell. I haven't tried it yet but think it might be able to be used as the oil in salad dressings- if you like the taste. As to the topical effect well first it just sits on your skin but after a minute or two it just disappears into your skin which continues to smell faintly of the smell I mentioned above. I think it does the job of softening skin- a sort of hydrating, softening effect on my hands which already were fine so the effect isn't noticeably apparent. My feet seem to be loving this stuff (put socks on after you put the oil on!) and seem to be smoother and stay that way all day. I actually bought it to eat- and from what I've read one or two teaspoons a day is a good amount for those who aren't sure if they get enough vitamin E in their diet<br /> (salad greens, whole wheat, sunflower seeds etc) I have read that vitamin E is antagonistic to estrogen so if you are on the pill you should see if this has any negative effects when taking the pill- I don't know the answer. In general too much estrogen isn't a good thing so perhaps this characteristic of vitamin E would be helpful to some- especially men who are worried about too much estrogen? Anyway you don't want to take too much of anything in particular and you can take too much vitamin E (fat soluble )but as far as I can tell that amount is more than a 'reasonable person' would think of taking anyway. I have only taken it for two days internally and already notice that my hands and feet seem to be a lot warmer and since it's supposed to be good for circulation that's to be expected. The company that makes it, Naissance, British, sourced from Scotland, has tried to make a topnotch product and I think has achieved it. I contacted the company several times with questions and they speedily answered them with friendly, helpful answers and were willing to do what was necessary to make me happy with my purchase.

AFNY5FSWFJHLFV3Z2W2GVAGH6UDA,B000GBICYE,5.0,"This is the fourth electric toothbrush I've owned in 7-8 years, and is by far my favorite.<br /><br />I did love my Interplak brushes, which came recommended by my dentist as having the best cleaning action, but they were not durable (hence ""brushes"" and not ""brush""). They say the key to getting an Interplak to last is to not use toothpaste, just dip the brush head into some Listerine. Sorry, but for me that wasn't a satisfying brushing experience.<br /><br />After two Interplaks died, I moved on to Sonicare. That brush is more durable. My husband is still using it. But when I went to the dentist and told the hygienist who cleaned my teeth that I used a Sonicare, she said that must be the reason my gums were bleeding. In fact, she said pretty much every patient she sees that has bleeding gums is using a Sonicare. I don't think she means that no one can clean their teeth successfully with that brand of brush, but apparently it fails a lot of people.<br /><br />I did find the Sonicare to be a very tough toothbrush to use because of what I'll call ""the splatter factor."" I couldn't brush some areas of my mouth very thoroughly without spraying toothpaste everywhere. I can't count the number of times I had to change my shirt after brushing in the morning. Because it was difficult to maneuver, I probably didn't brush my gums the way I should have.<br /><br />So, my dentist recommended a Braun / Oral B brush. Initially, they recommended a brush that cost more than $100. It had all kinds of bells and whistles, including a digital display that you could affix to your mirror which would tell you how well you were brushing. I decided to first try the Braun technology with this super-affordable model, partly because of my experience changing brushes over the years, and partly because the Oral B web site claimed the exact same plaque removing power (I think 97 percent) for every single brush they offer, regardless of price.<br /><br />This model has absolutely NO bells or whistles. It doesn't even have the standard LED light on the handle to show you when it's recharging. It just has one button that turns it on and off. That's all I need.<br /><br />A couple of key differences between the Sonicare and the Oral B brushes:<br /><br />1) With this Oral B brush, I can use REAL toothpaste.<br /><br />2) The entire brush head rotates, not the individual brushes. For me, this is more comfortable. It also takes the splatter factor down to about zero.<br /><br />3) Both brushes have a 2-minute timer, but whereas the Sonicare shuts off after two minutes, this Oral B brush gives a pulsing signal at two minutes and then keeps going. For me personally, this is preferred, because I rarely finish brushing in the two minutes allotted. When I'm done, I hit the power button.<br /><br />4) The standard brush head is smaller than some. That is by design -- you brush one tooth at a time rather than sweeping the brush across your teeth -- but some might prefer something with more coverage.<br /><br />It's been several months. My gums are healthier and the battery is going strong. I just bought an additional Vitality brush for my preschool-age son, who's finding it very manageable.<br /><br />My one real complaint is the same one I have had about every electric toothbrush I've owned, which is that you have to remove the brush head  and rinse off the brush mechanism after each use. If you don't, you get a raunchy build-up in that area. I guess there must be something that requires the brushes to be engineered this way, since it's the way all the manufacturers make them. Just be aware of this as you care for your brush.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: You aren't going to beat the value of this brush. It's outstanding technology at a terrific price (and the Amazon price is $3-5 less than what you'll find at retailers).",True,1,0,1,2
AH7R2XPWHAAHRHO3KZAZ7M3JASXQ,B000FEIOHW,2.0,"At first I thought this was going to be the solution to the problem of the original rechargeable Sonicare toothbrush with batteries that can't be replaced (my original Sonicare stopped holding a charge).<br /><br />However, after only four months (just long enough to waste money replacing the brush head!), the button began to only work erratically, and now it does not work at all (can't power the toothbrush on).<br /><br />The reviews that state that the battery compartment does not keep water out are completely true.  The battery compartment is always moist, and the batteries will begin to rust.<br /><br />I was pleased that my Eneloop batteries worked well to power the toothbrush, so I could be using rechargeable batteries, however it doesn't matter if the toothbrush itself doesn't last past 6 months.<br /><br />The batteries that came with the toothbrush lasted around a month.  The Eneloops needed charged only once in the next three months.<br /><br />Looks like the Sonicare brand just fails on too many levels, regardless of whether you are using the ultra-expensive rechargeable unit, or this unit with two AA batteries.<br /><br />[Update] Flashlights have had ""screw on"" caps for nearly one hundred hears.  The Sonicare toothbrush is the same form factor.  I have no idea why someone at Philips thought a ""clip on"" cap (vs. a screw on) would be better, ESPECIALLY for something you use with water.  I am still COMPLETELY BAFFLED by why they would use this design.  The battery compartment will ALWAYS be moist.  Being able to use rechargeable batteries is clearly superior to being stuck with the Philips Soincare charging station.  However, the fact that your batteries get wet means you will eventually ruin your batteries.  That said, I am about to purchase another one.  Being able to use your own batteries makes it a when, both for the fact that you can replace the batteries and also so that the (much more expensive) toothbrush isn't useless when the internal batteries fail after a year or so.

I tend to avoid hair products that contain the word oil in the product description as I do not need any help in it becoming oily. I also do not use conditioner regularly due to the nature of my hair.<br />My first thoughts upon opening my package of the InstaNatural Argan Oil Shampoo, was that it was well protected by the quality seals. There is a thin plastic cover over the bottle to prevent leakage during shipment, and another quality seal that you have to remove by taking off the top of the bottle. The first thing I do when I go to buy or use a new shampoo is to smell it. When ordering hair products online, you do not get to smell before you buy and have to depend on the seller or reviews for a description of the scent. The scent of this shampoo is a clean scent. It is mild and not overwhelming. It is not a perfume smell or a fruity smell. The best way I can describe it is a nice clean mild smell.<br />I started with hair that had been washed the day before, so it was oily and ready for another wash. I wet my hair and applied about a quarter size amount to my hair. I have shoulder length hair, so I do not need much. This shampoo has an amazing lather to it. It is thick and you can really feel it working through your hair. I scrubbed it in from the scalp to the ends. Then I rinsed. I am one of those that needs to feel/hear the squeak when I am rinsing to know my hair is really clean. And this shampoo passed that test very well. I did not use any conditioner afterwards, because I do not normally, unless it is a weekly treatment.<br />I usually air dry my hair, and I did this time as well. My hair came out so soft and full of body and did not have any heavy feeling to it. I woke up this morning without the greasy/oily feel I usually get the next day after I wash. I was very surprised by this, because like I said that is normally what my hair feels like unless I wash it daily. It is still soft and feels silky to the touch.<br />I had my fiance do the sniff test to see what he thought of the smell, and he said it smelled nice.<br />If you are like me and have been avoiding any shampoos because of the description having oil in it, I would say to give this one a try.

That probably took me an eighth of the time it normally takes me and that is no joke!<br />I've used hot combs: the ones that you plug in and the old school ones that go straight off the stove on to your hair with embers sparking my hair and everything. I've used ceramic and different metal plated flat irons. I've spent hundreds of dollars on irons and I spent $30 on irons, and this has got to be the most awesome invention for hair straightening yet! I even was desperate enough one time that I used a clothes iron on my hair to get done quicker. It shaved a couple of hours off but wasn't worth the damage and the scalp that I couldn't get that close too.<br />I like how you can see what the temperature is and you can put it on the temperature that you would prefer. It's really easy to read and lots of really bright. The buttons are easy to push and are clearly labeled. Don't be alarmed when you first look at the bristles. It doesn't look like it would come very well because it looks so rubbery, but it really does a great job. As you can see in the video, I still brushed before I used the straightening brush, only because I wanted to have is a little heat on my hair as possible and I didn't want to be worrying about tangles. That's another thing, when I straighten my hair, I go back and forth constantly with a brush or comb and the flat iron to make sure I'm not heating the hair in a awkward position.

It works so well and it's really convenient. The only thing that I would change is how hot the back of the brush gets.

I marked this down a star for two reasons, one I wish the color groupings were banded separately because trying to pick through and find just the one (or ones you want) only made us tangle the hair more and we had to stop and comb it to untangle it. Having them packaged separately instead as one big grouping would have saved us this trouble. The other reason is because the colored crimp rings that come with them has a clear plastic or rubber ring inside them that must be removed for the extension to fit through. The instructions said nothing about this and I was getting frustrated on the first one I did thinking it wasn't going to fit until I knocked that clear inside ring out of the way and then it worked fine.

So I was a bit skeptical about this cuticle pusher because all I have ever used are the bamboo stick ones which dull very quickly and it seems I'm always purchasing, the cost was adding up so I haven't bought them in awhile and try to make do with what I have. This did seem like a bit much to pay for, but when you think about what you are saving in costs of disposables and how many years this one will last you it is not as bad as I had thought. Now prices always change on here so it may be a different amount when you look into purchasing it so just do the same thing, weigh the cost of buying disposables with how much it is currently selling for.<br /><br />Now when it arrived it came in a plastic slip cover that you can keep it clean while being stored. It's simple and cheap, but I didn't mark it down because it's considered packaging. Something a little more durable would have been good. I'm not sure how long it will last before it starts to tear at the seams from taking the pusher in and out.<br /><br />The pusher itself is all metal which is really nice as it means you can toss it in the dishwasher or a pot of boiling water to sanitize it often which is a good idea since it's not disposable and your hands, especially your nails carry a ton of germs! The end is flat enough and slightly rounded or smoothed off at the end so that it does not feel sharp against your skin at all. I was worried since I'm used to softer wood that the metal would be painful to use but it really hasn't been each time I've used it. It will work on the cuticles themselves, but I highly recommend soaking your hands in a bit of warm/hot (what you can tolerate or enjoy) slightly soapy water with a few drops of essential oil (again of your liking) in it for some moisturizing and cleaning. This will help to soften them up and make them easier to slide back. Once your done put a bit of oil or other cuticle moisturizer or cream on to keep them feeling good! Whenever you use lotion make sure to rub a bit into the cuticles to keep them feeling soft and good, or if you really have the time use the specialized cuticle creams or lotions every day on them!<br /><br />Once I'm done if I had washed my hands really well and soaked them I might not sanitize this each time like you really should, but I will every few uses or if I picked it up and just started pushes at my dry cuticles without thinking about it or washing my hands!",False,1,1,1,3

I started using it once a day, then twice a day but switched to once every three days on the lowest setting. My skin is still smooth so I don’t want to overdo it. You will see redness but it goes away fairly quickly. I wet my face, I wet the device and add my cleanser directly it. You can use less cleanser because the device distributes it nicely. This seems to work best with a cream cleanser. It stays on for 2 minutes but 1 minute should suffice. It doesn’t have a beep to let you know when to switch sections. The last setting that dries the device is a nice touch. I only get water on the bristles so I can’t speak on it being waterproof.

I have very long, very thick, highly porous, somewhat dry, very frizzy, naturally curly hair. My curly hair type is about a 3A/3B. Now about the shampoo. The shampoo is completely sulfate and silicone free (I don't use sulfates or silicones in my hair), and while washing my hair the very first time, it actually felt like it was moisturizing my hair while actually getting it clean, and not stripping my hair at all. Like, that's quite a trifecta! I've found that a lot of sulfate free shampoos don't leave your hair feeling quite clean, but this one really does. That shampoo doesn't smell like much, it smells fresh, but doesn't have a powerful odor at all. The conditioner, however, is amazing! I wasn't expecting much from it because it has so few ingredients, which are mostly oils, but holy cow, this stuff felt amazing on my hair! A lot of silicone free conditioners don't have much slip, so it makes detangling your hair in the shower a bit difficult, but this was super easy, my fingers glided right through my hair, my hair felt silky, and best of all, it didn't take a ton of product to achieve this effect like it does with a lot of conditioners. The conditioner definitely has more of an herbal scent to it, but it's a pleasant one that I enjoy, and I don't think it's objectionable to anyone.

AHJOWKLJYQT4VSNUO5HLEKRVOHZA,B01C7532DM,5.0,"I have always coveted long nails, but with weak, bendy nails that peal and break easily it was never achievable. I'm a DIY girl when it comes to nails. I have been doing my own gel manicures for years and most recently have been using Brisa lite smoothing gel for added strength. It helped but manicures still started chipping at the 10 day mark and as soon as my nails got to the desired length they would start breaking.<br />By comparison this stuff is amazing! Its all the strength without the bulk of regular acrylic. They are my real nails but nothing will break them.The process itself is faster since you don't have to cure for two minutes each time. The coats between and after powder are just thin glue. Its also more forgiving as the coats are all even and solidly applied. You buff and clean up in the middle of the process which makes everything even and your edges perfect. I've also filed and such after they are done without issue.<br />I actually ordered from Revel itself, but read the reviews here first. Revel colors are also cheaper then gel's options, with a one ounce jar of color only costing about $8. One ounce jar is probably like 8-10 manicures. Sure beats paying a salon $40 every two weeks.<br />Removal is slightly different. I use the cotton ball with nail caps method and find it slightly more time consuming then gel, but I think that's only because I'm still getting used to it. When exposed to acetone the dip turns into a chewed gum consistency. So unlike my CND shellac that peals off I'm rubbing off sticky blobs. But I also probably just need to try soaking it an extra 5 minutes and stop being impatient.<br />But the extra removal time is totally worth it when you consider the manicures last longer, are stronger, and allow me to finally have my dream long nails.",False,1,0,1,2

The bristles were made from boars’ hair and the handle from bamboo. Nylon bristles came about around 1938. Today, some toothbrushes still use boar’s bristles, however, some say there are concerns about the action of the natural bristles on the enamel and gums, so many still recommend soft nylon bristles. Here, we have a natural bamboo handle, which is sturdy and durable, with little to no bend and very smooth, so someone took time to sand this down. The bristles are very soft. Which is easy on the gums and enamel. The toothbrush head and handle are perfect for a little one’s mouth, allowing access to those small to reach places. Practicing good oral hygiene is so important, at a young age. Our little one found this toothbrush perfect in size to maneuver about and the bristles comfortable. We see no shedding of a single bristle at this early stage; and plan to rotate this out of commission, after its effectiveness appears of concern, after a bad cold, or just after so many months of service. With that in mind, cost is always a concern. These are no bargain basement toothbrushes. They are a premium product in our opinion and are priced accordingly.  Bamboo toothbrush handles can be composted, used as kindling, and can be repurposed for other household uses. However, just like plastic toothbrush handles, they will take up space in a landfill if just thrown away. We reconsidered using plastic toothbrushes, and now choose bamboo toothbrushes as an alternative to the plastic, which ends up in landfills. Plastic is not designed to break down and plastic toothbrushes are difficult to recycle. We decided bamboo to be an excellent alternative to reduce plastic waste at home. Finally, our little one gave this bamboo toothbrush, with its cute design laser burned into the handle two (2) thumbs up for fit, having that fun handle design, unique style, soft bristle comfort, lack of odor, and ease of using.

And they had tried EVERYTHING, with no relief at all. I have known for some years about the healing powers of colloidal silver in all of its many forms.  So I sent them both a couple of jars of this cream to apply to their rashes. In fact, I sent them multiple options of topical and internal “natural”/non-pharma remedies to try.

Both have reported back to me that it gave them literal IMMEDIATE, though not permanent, relief from the pain and itching when they apply this cream - so much so that they have re-ordered in larger quantities.  The rash is much improved, and far better than it was, but so far, after more than a month, not completely cured.

You are not coating your hair with Arian oil but a rubber derivative. So th cuticle lays down short term but never gets the moisture that is causing the damage and frizz to begin with.

In case you were not aware, waxing is messy, even for a person who tries to be meticulous and keep things neat while involved with this task.<br />Let me take a moment to get this out before I go any further ... Bwahahahahaha<br />Ok.<br />I recently treated myself to a wax warmer because I wanted to wax larger areas and not have to run to the microwave frequently. Since the warmer pot is metal,the spatula can be scraped and kept reasonably clean during the waxing process.

I cannot stress enough that time is something once spent, can’t be recovered. It’s precious!!<br />- You are not struggling to apply wax (as much as that’s possible)!<br />- This is small enough to allow quick, controlled applications in multiple areas while you wait for it to cool. Then rip away!<br />- Small enough to do parts of the face, but not under the eyebrows.<br />- Enough control to allow what you choose for size, direction, thickness and a little thicker pulling edge with minimal struggling.

AFIEU7P4FWBXHQBWJPZP6USHDHYA,B00IAA79JC,5.0,"I first purchased this soap at a Beauty Supply store near my house to use solely as a facial cleanser. I have a condition called Seborrheic Dermatitis, which causes raised, red, flaky rashes around my nose and mouth. It's similar to eczema and can be embarrassing, itchy, and uncomfortable. I treated it with medication prescribed by a dermatologist but after graduating from college, I suddenly found myself uninsured. I had heard about the effectiveness of both black soap and tea tree oil in treating various skin conditions like mine, so I was intrigued by a soap that provided both.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is how unprocessed it was compared to other black soap I've seen. This looks as if it's all natural. I've never used black soap before so I can't compare it to other products in anyway except appearance and price. Erzuli wasn't as pretty but it was more affordable.<br /><br />So the bottom line is...IT WORKS! It has completely tamed my seborrheic dermatitis as well or better than the steroidal medication I had been prescribed by my dermatologist, except without the cost and side effects.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />1) It feels odd. Perhaps, it's the tea tree oil but it feels as if there's some type of film over my face when I'm using it. It's not a bad feeling, just different than regular soap. At least in my head, it makes me feel as if my skin is actually getting moisturized.<br /><br />2) A little goes a very long way. This soap lasts forever....well at least if you only use it on your face like me. It lathers up like crazy. So don't waste it. I usually just rub it in my hands a couple times and than rub my hands together, which produces more than enough lather to wash my face. One bar has lasted months.<br /><br />3) It's messy. This is probably the biggest downside. The texture of this product is not like traditional soap. It becomes ""gummy"" after being exposed to water. I can literally take the bar of soap and bend it. It can actually get quite messy so I had to by a container to put the soap in which starts to look quite gross after a while.<br /><br />4) It tingles. I've heard black soap can tingle/burn a little, I definitely know tea tree oil can. So the two together means that if you leave it on your face for too long, it may start to burn a little. It's nothing too intense and for all I know, that might just mean it's working but I do try to let it sit on my face for only a minute or two before washing it off.<br /><br />5) The smell. There is not a strong tea tree oil smell, which for me is a plus. I wasn't sure what to expect but the scent is mild and inoffensive.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from a skin condition similar to mine. I just bought the pack of 2 here on Amazon, which was slightly more expensive than I had seen at the brick and mortar store but they were out of stock, and I couldn't bare the thought of running out.

AE6QUS7S2CMWBBXNYR3K64A5BNHQ,B00XNQX7US,5.0,"This is my review of the Ifill K-Cup user fill system.  All in all, the system delivers a steady clean means of filling K-Cup bodies with coffee.  Below I will compare my experience with 4 different scenarios for drinking coffee from a K-Cup system<br /><br />1. A standard dark roast K-cup cartridge.  This was a non-Keurig brand that contained 10.76 grams of coffee.  The coffee was of reasonable flavor, very convenient to use, and with no mess to make, the capsule is too complicated to recycle. Most expensive system to use $0.50 to more than $1.00 per serving.<br />2. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen.  -  User filled screen capsule.  Somewhat messy to fill, brews reasonable tasting coffee, but will leave a little sediment of ground in your cup.  Holds 10.20 grams of coffee. The system is a pain to clean out.  Least expensive system as the screen cup may be reused many times over.<br />3. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen with added paper filter – User filled screen capsule with disposable paper filter that fits inside of the plastic screen capsule.  Takes a while to get the hang of fitting the filter into the capsule.  The system holds a little less coffee at 10.06 grams of coffee. The drinkable coffee produced has very little sediment in your cup.  This system is a little bit easier to clean up, but not much.  The filter cup removes fairly easily, but there is still a fair amount of rinsing of the plastic capsule to get rid of the coffee grounds that are on the top of the capsule lid.  Slightly more expensive due to having to purchase filters.<br />4. The IFill Cup -  The is a user fillable cup single use system.  The cup has a preinstalled filter that does well producing sediment free coffee.  The attached lid is made of foil that is supported by a plastic ring that is hinged to the IFill cup body.  Each lid has a very effective gummy seal that works well during the brewing process to keep coffee ground contained within the IFill Cup. After filling with grounds, the caps stay sealed to the cup body and seem to be shelf stable for more than a week.  So just fill a bunch in one session and you off to caffeine heaven for another week.  There is some potential mess when originally filling new cups, but the ability to simple toss the used cup without any mess is a great plus.  A lightly filled cup held 10.86 grams of coffee.  At this fill there seem to be very few leaks when the brew process is working.  A very densely packed and somewhat overfilled cup held 14.72 grams.  In this situation there was some leaking from the cup lid at the water insertion point, but this cup was fill to the point of abuse.  I believe this system is more expensive than using an Echo Cup but is much less hassle to use.  The system is less expensive than using factory filled K-cups.  So if you want to know what is in your KCup every morning, and don’t mind setting down and filling new capsules with coffee every once in a while – this is your system!<br /><br />Can you reuse an IFIll cup?  I guess you could, but I am not sure that hassle of cleaning out, drying, and hoping that the single use gum seal would work well would be worth the bother.<br /><br />Can you recycle the product?  The company says yes, in reality I would guess that being most other KCup devices are not recyclable when the cup finally gets to the recycle guy for sorting, they are going to “Think KCup” and sort it directly into the trash.<br /><br />All in all, the IFill seems to be a great user fill KCup system.  Nice flavor from your own beans, easy setup, use and disposal of the product.  – I will be reordering more soon!",True,1,0,1,2

AGMU3GG4QZRUH7I2QQUTE4JQNCYQ,B078VZMJKN,5.0,"SUMMARY:<br />I found these blades to be a much lower cost, good-excellent quality alternative to stock Gillette blades.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE?  Note, however, I always perform proper cleaning maintenance after each shave.  To wit: I brush off the blades using the tooth brush bristles to get in between the blades, then blow on it a few times to clear off most of any remaining water droplets.  This greatly retards oxidation and corrosion of the blade edges.  For anyone groaning right now, that &#34;whole big process&#34; takes all of 10 seconds!  That's fast by any measure.<br /><br />LIFE:<br />Using the above standard methodology of use, I got just as long a use per blade as stock Gillette's ... roughly 2 months per blade ..  before there is a any hint of snagging, rather than cutting, my hairs.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />I found the slightly larger size of the blade head felt a bit odd but only on the very 1st shave.  It soon felt good, even reassuring, as it provided a broader surface to go over my skin.<br /><br />CUTS?<br />One reviewer said they cut him easily.  I, too, have been cut, but it was by the stock Gillette blades. Frankly, it's going to happen with any blade ... eventually.  Some units of any make blades will be slightly off on rare occasion or have inconsistent edges than can cut or scratch.  Then, there's the matter of user technique.<br /><br />After 4-5 decades on this earth, a shaver should get a sense of their skin hairs, how they slant, how sensitive the skin is underneath, and, most importantly, how tough their skin has become.  These things are even more critical for women who are forced to shave areas infinitely more sensitive than those of men. Mature adults usually have tougher skin from loss of collagen, sun degradation, and for simply having shaved many 1,000's of times.  Younger shavers tend to have sensitive skin and are less attuned to the proper angles at which to pull the shaver to deal with their skin profile.<br /><br />I took the above side trip to highlight that for some, the minutest difference in blades could cause some shavers to cut themselves - not necessarily due to blade defects or construction style but, perhaps, simply because they have not spent as much time adapting their technique to a new blade as they did to their previous one.  That is, days or weeks versus many years!  Remember how many times new shavers cut themselves when 1st shaving?  The same experiential curve applies to those changing blade models - not matter their age or shaving experience level.<br /><br />VALUE:<br />So far, for me, these low cost blades are a tremendous value. Plus I bought a 5 pack for $0.97 on a 1-time CVS sale. Then bought another at the regular (way cheaper than OEM) price of $16 for 10.  So, I'm good for another 1.25 years at 2 months per blade.<br /><br />COST PER SHAVE:<br />Excluding the clearance price I got on a 5-pack, the $16 price for 10 = $1.60 each.  With a mean time to replacement of 2 months (for me), that equates to $1.60 / 60 days = $0.0267 cents per shave or roughly $0.81 / month or $9.74 / year.<br /><br />BLADE AGING PROFILE:<br />The &#34;newness&#34; feeling and sharpness wore off at about the same rate as do my Gillette blades.<br />To wit: 1-5 shaves = feels like new using 2-3 strokes/pass<br />  5-20 = 3-4 strokes/pass<br />20-40 = 4-5 strokes/pass<br />40-60 = 5-6 strokes/pass<br />Only then do I toss and replace unless, of course, I come upon a blade that seems to have aged quicker for whatever reason.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />They look, feel, and age not much differently than Gillette blades and cost 50-75% less.

It definitely has the airy, ethereal fragrance of a delicate powder, leaving a pleasant and gentle scent wafting after washing—no additional cologne or perfume needed Though it takes between (an estimated) 1-2 tablespoons of the gel to get sufficient lathering action, once it does, it cleans well and does result in that wonderful fragrance post showering.  One claim from the promo text I do somewhat question is that of “perfectly moisturized skin.” I would have to say that any moisturizing properties are just average, not exceptional. Part of the evaluation criteria is assessing thickness and packaging. Thickness is exactly what I would expect it to be, remaining where it’s poured lying atop a washcloth and neither running off nor penetrating the cloth until appropriate action is taken. As for the packaging, the design appeal of colors and shape get high marks. Unfortunately, my bottle is one where the pump would never fully unlock, dispensing only a minute amount at a time, which is both impractical and extremely frustrating. I’ve had to remove the pump and pour, which is much less efficient. Generally, this product would be toward the outside price range of what I would consider, but I do think its exceptional fragrance makes it worthwhile purchase both for a gift or for personal use knowing it will result in a clean, soft fragrance requiring no additional products.",False,1,1,0,2

The aluminum packaging is crinkly, but IOPE explains that it's due to their sterilization process (they sterilize the masks in the packaging).<br /><br />I've tried many many Korean masks, but I've never had one whiten my skin the way this one does. It whitens by making my pores disappear. At first I thought some kind of white substance must be filling in my pores, but the essence is clear and even if I rub the product off my skin, the pores are still gone (not visible). Either my pores are getting super cleaned or super tightened. I'm excited either way by these masks. I don't have acne or sensitive skin, but I do have large pores from harsh acne treatments 10 years ago. These masks make my skin look like snow without those ugly blackheads showing.

I try to organize stuff on the weekends so I can just grab and go every morning while packing my lunch for work.<br />These containers are going to be great for my purpose, I can tell already! They hold a tad more than half a cup (I poured 1/2 cup water in one to test it and there was still a small amount of room above the water line). The included liner is fantastic. I only tested one container so far, but it was the one I put 1/2 cup of water in. I put the liner on the container, screwed the top on and turned it upside down, sideways, and shook it. No leakage! Very impressive. I probably won't use liquid in these containers but it's nice to know they don't leak if I find a liquid I want to put in them. I might just take yogurt in them!<br /><br />I've included pictures so you can see the size, how well they are made and how they came packaged. There was bubble wrap around the package of containers, then they were in plastic under the bubble wrap also. I had to get my scissors out to get into the bubble wrap, it was on securely.<br />The containers themselves seem to be a medium thick plastic, definitely not flimsy. There is nothing on them to indicate the type of plastic they are made of, but Houseables says they are made of polypropylene and safe for spices, cooking oils, etc. The Livestrong website states &#34;Polypropylene containers do not leach harmful chemicals into foods or liquids. They commonly contain yogurt, medicine, drinks, ketchup and medicines.&#34;<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the included liners, as I imagined they would be the same type of liners you get in the top of some medicine bottles - a thin piece of waterproof paper that won't last long.

I never gave multi-head rotary shavers much thought...until this one. This shaver beats EVERY electric shaver I haver ever owned or tried for shave quality...even ""dry"" (without using any kind of pre-shave). With a pre-shave lotion it is even better. This is a great on-the-road shaver to keep in your car for those super-quick erasures of 6-o'clock shadows.<br /><br />This thing is super quiet.

It has a countdown charge timer built into the on-off switch that starts at 60 (supposed minutes) but after a good estimated half hour of shaving mine only ticked down to about 43 before I plugged it in to my laptop to charge. It only comes with a USB charging corder (it's proprietary at one end so don't lose it!) that can plug into any power-providing standard USB port. Many hotels now have USB charging ports on their bathroom outlets and you even find them on things like inexpensive power strips. Of course, you can purchase a standalone USB charger...but I see no need in my case give this thing seems to just ""sip"" power and would likely last a multi-week business trip without the need to charge.<br /><br />Its flip out trimmer is rather smallish but gets the job done and trims very closely.

I used this model before I got the Spa set:  [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Series 7-7181 Silk Epil Wet & Dry Epilator 1 Count]]<br /><br />I still love the epilator portion and think that the little ""headlight"" and the bumpy rollers make things more efficient and less uncomfortable (uncomfortable if you have previously epilated or painful if you are a newbie to mechanically ripping the hair out of your legs).  The Silk Epil 7 handle is comfortable to hold, it is wet/dry, though I do not like wet epilation (it just doesn't do as thorough a job, for me as doing it dry).  I have tried other models from Braun and this one: [[ASIN:B004KMIZK6 Emjoi Optima Corded Epilator]] and at first I thought the Emjoi was the cat's pajamas, but the Silk Epil 7 (and even the 5) is far superior in regards to features, discomfort, and efficiency.  I have not even looked at the Emjoi since making the move to the Braun hair rippers.<br /><br />About the brush/spa attachment:<br />The ""sonic"" brush head dresses up the body of the Silk Epil 7 so it sort of looks like one of those Clarisonic type brushes.  At first I was excited that this would replace my Clarisonic and be a space saving and effort saving 2-in-1 extravaganza.  Such is not the case.  The brush head/attachment for the Silk Epil 7 is strictly for body only and NOT FOR THE FACE.  The brush head is good for regular body brushing/exfoliating to help prevent ingrown hairs (something I have never had a problem with since I started using an epilator, but many people do have that problem and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure).  I wanted to use it all over, not just where I used the epilator, and it feels fairly strong and abrasive compared to the more gentle (and quiet!) sounds of my Clarisonic with body brush head.  I came out of the shower and was bright pink.  My sensitive skin does ok with the Clarisonic, and fine with an exfoliating washcloth but the Silk Epil brush left me bright pink and feeling like I spent the day at the beach.  It did, though, make my feet look quite smooth and the sonic vibration and brush were strong enough that my tired feet did feel pampered, though my legs looked about the same.  Perhaps other users find the brush more helpful if they use their Silk Epil 7 in the shower.  I prefer to epilate dry skin/dry hair, so the only reason I would take it in the shower is to exfoliate the rest of my body, rather than as an adjunct to exfoliation.  The brush assembly/attachment was not that friendly as far as being able to angle the whole device to exfoliate my back and the head kept popping off, which was rather annoying and made me think that it is meant more for just the legs (and if just for the legs it seems almost excessive, but some may benefit from the sonic brushing to prevent ingrown hairs- potentially...).",False,1,1,1,3

The next morning, I got up and the red spot was peeling like it was sunburn! It had burnt me to some extent. What color did go on wasn't that good. Maybe I should have used black.

The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.

That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.

I've just turned 50 and it's a constant battle to keep my skin hydrated just due to the aging process.

I try to do at LEAST one a week, but as it gets colder I've been using them every few days.  I'll use them at night after I've cleansed and used my prescription skincare and then I'll follow up with my nightly routine.  I love all of the plant extracts loaded into this one along with the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  One thing to keep in mind though is that if you're using this (or anything with hyaluronic acid, really) and you're in a dry climate you need to make sure you provide additional moisture for the HA to bind to.  It's why I use this one at night since I keep a humidifier running on my bedside table that pumps that moisture into the air.

This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly ""showy"" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.  Definitely a keeper!!",False,1,1,1,3

The only thing that I've found that covers these completely is concealer for the first two, only two primers do the job on the pores that I've found.  I figured this might give me some additional coverage due to the nude tint so maybe I could skip the concealer and just go with foundation for coverage.  I was also hoping it would be another primer that would blur/fill the pores and not just ""disappear"" after foundation gets applied.<br /><br />I was actually impressed by the tone correction I got from this.  It's not a concealer (obviously), so I wasn't expecting full coverage.  I was just looking for a muting of the redness & the sun spots so I could maybe skip the concealer.  It did exactly that.  It provided a veil of nude tint that made my areas of sun damage and sun spots (yeah, they're freckles) almost disappear.  The redness was muted somewhat.  Enough that I when I skipped the concealer I was pretty happy with the result I got from just this product under my foundation.  That being said, it doesn't play well with every foundation.  I noticed that it doesn't seem to work as well with my dewy/hydrating foundations.  That may just be a ""me thing"", but I thought I'd throw it out there for consideration.<br /><br />So, this leads to the pore filling/smoothing.  It does smooth out some areas with pores and it does continue to do that after the foundations is applied.....in some areas.  Which seem to be in the areas that don't move a lot.  So on my face, I have enlarged pores on the side of my nose in the nostril area and down toward my mouth, on my chin, and on my forehead in the center.  Now, everyone's face moves but we don't all emote with our faces in the same areas.  I tend to have a very expressive mouth and I arch one eyebrow a lot.  I don't furrow or wrinkle my forehead much.  The primer didn't hold up on my chin or around the nostrils and down toward my mouth.  The center of the forehead held up perfectly.<br />So, while I like this primer for the tone correction, I need something that smooths my pores in all areas of my face.  If you're just looking for a good primer to even out your skin tone or provide some base color correction I would absolutely recommend this one.  The pore thing....I think that's going to be something that depends on the person.  This definitely has a place in my makeup routine.

This product says it is vegan, paraben free, etc. which is lovely, but it doesn’t list the percentage of active ingredients so there’s no way of knowing exactly what you are putting on your face. I also had an issue with the dropper. I’m not sure how this could have happened, but tip of the dropper seems to have been smashed off, leaving a jagged edge that could actually cut your face. This may have occurred in shipping but seeing as the dropper is secured in the center of the bottle I’m not sure how.<br /><br />I will continue to use this product and will update my review if my before and after pictures show any noticeable difference when I have used the entire bottle, but as it stands there is no noticeable improvement in my skin.",False,1,1,1,3

I think Norelco the best products, not to say they are extraordinary, just that they are the best compared to what is available. The Arcitec 1090 is the  3rd top-of-the-line product I have purchased from Norelco, with the rationale that if I buy the best product there is, for my tough and fast-growing beard, I must be getting the best the market offers. But yet again I am disappointed to find out that, like the prior 2 replacements, the next generation of Norelco products are not necessarily better than the prior, just different and more expensive. I grow thick beard very quickly (with 24 hours). Like the predecessors (Quadra and XL series) the Arcitec does a good job around my cheeks and moustache area, but a poor good job around the neck. As prior models, I usually give up in mid-shave and end my finishing with a  Gilette razor for the neck area. Very disappointing. Not only w/ the Arcitec, but the same story has repeated w/ prior models, I sometimes pass the shaver over and over again over hairs left behind without success...I wish Norelco came up w/ products designed to tackle thick and abundant beard (I am Spanish, the same type of hair Italian and Middle Eastern men grow).",True,1,1,0,2

AHVOLTYQE2RVYDFIUO56MNDIDNYQ,B01HLTYVN4,4.0,"This product gets a lot of mixed reviews and that’s probably because people have the wrong idea as to what this mask actually does. At first my expectations were completely off too. It’s a peel off mask so I’m expecting to pull something out expect “What? It didn’t pull anything out at all!” However, the one thing that made me rethink this mask was that even though it didn’t pull anything physical out of my face I did notice these tiny little white spots on the peeled mask and at first I thought they were air bubbles. The next time I used it, I made sure I didn’t have any air bubbles, one slick, black, mask. When I peeled it off again, there they were! Little white spots that are slightly translucent, then it finally clicked. This mask is called Sebum Out! It says nothing about blackheads or whiteheads removal, its meant to tackle sebum (precursor to black/white heads) which is oily/waxy so if the mask is to pull anything out… it’s not going to be anything with a physical shape hence those translucent little spots!<br /><br />Now with that cleared up, it’s a totally different kind of review! It is very soothing. It’s got a thick gooey consistency and spreads pretty easily. Bare in mind that the thinner you apply this on your face the harder it is to take off. My rule is to apply enough that I no longer see my skin tone coming from underneath the mask. It’s shiny black and smells somewhat minty but very light and the rest of the scent borders medicinal/earthy which isn’t bad or anything. After you apply it, its very cooling and minty. It takes a bit of time to dry completely especially if some areas have a thicker application. The peeling process is pretty painless and easy, slow and steady though. Overall it’s a pleasant experience.

I applied it all by myself- no extra hands. I tried to follow their steps but I go frustrated doing it and practically it’s impossible to follow those steps if you are doing it alone.<br /><br />So eventually I ended up (almost) massaging it on my hair and let it sit for 15 minutes. Blow drying the hair after that is the hardest part.

When the hair's wet, it's harder for the vacuum to pull it in.  I also found that the vacuum works much better on longer hair then on shorter hair.  Maybe the shorter hairs are too light and get blown around?  Last but not least, watch out for the settings.  The dial goes 1-9 so I started with 4, which was way too short.

AE7VA2DANZV5AXNHPE747JX7X7UQ,B000HHANVW,5.0,"I've been using brand X for years, and liked it, but like everyone else resented that the battery determined its useful life. I decided to try a battery operated unit with which I could use rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I got my hands on both brands and the vibration in the Sonicare is visibly more aggressive in its cleaning action without damaging teeth or hurting gums. The vibration hums instead of rattles. Try it -- you'll see what I mean.<br />As I came to Amazon to shop for my product, I was turned off by the frequent bad reviews about leakage into the battery compartment. I frankly do not know whether that is still a problem, as one reviewer said he believed Sonicare had solved the problem.<br />When I ordered my brush, I also ordered an inexpensive container of O-Ring lubricant. No need to buy food quality or scuba quality, any lubricant will do. Vaseline may well do the trick, but petroleum is bad on rubber, and since I do not know the material on the Sonicare O-Ring, I thought it better to spend a couple of bucks for a small, inexpensive tube of silicone lubricant.  O-Ring lubricants serve three primary purposes: first, it keeps the o-ring supple. Second, it lubricates the surface to make it easier to reassemble the cover without damaging the o-ring when you replace the battery. And third, it prevents leakage.  I noticed that the unit I purchased has a flat stand so that this unit is laid on its side when it is not being used, instead of standing upright where any water remaining in the head can drip down and find its way into that battery compartment. I have not had my unit very long, but I intend to watch that battery compartment and will update this review if my brush leaks despite my precautions.<br /><br />I fully expect, however, that this Sonicare Extreme will outlive the 2 1/2 year warranty.<br /><br />I did not mention that Sonicare extends their normal 2 year warranty by six months if you go online to register your product. I expect I'll have to tolerate a few emailed special offers for that extra six months, but maybe it will turn out to be a good investment. That's a pretty long warranty for a product that is used as frequently as this thing -- and certainly will outlive the rechargeable units I've been using.<br />UPDATE: I've now had this unit for about two months, and in that time I've replaced the NiMH batteries twice for re-charging. The brush takes excellent care of my teeth and gums -- aggressive without being destructive. Most importantly, the silicone grease I'm using on the o-ring that seals the battery compartment is keeping that compartment clean and dry. I haven't changed my mind -- expect this product to last its full two and a half year warranty, and beyond, since I can just swap out the batteries. We have two of these in the household and both are working like Swiss watches.",False,1,0,1,2
AEWXY77733AXJZ2SUC4NWZR4L4GA,B07GY1ZDFR,4.0,"I really enjoy using this oil on my skin. It smells fantastic and seems to absorb quickly, so it doesn’t feel greasy.

Peppermint and Eucalyptus Essential oils are not recommended on children under the age of six and 10 respectively, so I would not use this on babies or toddlers despite the recommendation on the insert. Children under the age of two should generally avoid topical use of any essential oil. Yes, the oils in this product appear to be highly diluted, but I wouldn’t chance it. They are still smelling it even if you’re not putting it on them.<br /><br />2. I’m hesitant to use anything with essential oils as an “intimate” lubricant as recommended. Too much potential (in my mind) for mucosal membrane damage, and no, I’m not talking about your nose. Also, oil-based lubricants will break down latex, so be aware of this.<br /><br />Other than the above concerns I mentioned (which are not concerns if you are using it correctly) I really like using this moisturizer.

The eyelashes looked ""unkempt"" compared to the others and less natural because the fibers were double layered. The magnets on the back were such poor quality! They had weak magnetic power (compared to Newcally, LAMIX, and Coolours but same as Yiwamica) and they were glued on haphazardly. The spacing was uneven and they were all crooked. Yiwamica had magnet issues too, where the magnets were weak and some even fell off, but at least those lashes looked more natural. This brand was the worst.<br /><br />Two pros:<br />--Lashes fibers were thinner so looked more natural compared to the better quality brands and slightly less black<br />--The liner wasn't too bad. The consistency was actually pretty good, neither goopy nor too liquid, but the lash magnets are bad so not going to keep just for the liner!<br /><br />I would recommend Newcally for the best quality (but least natural).

AFSPGS44EYOO4ZLJY4ZBIWNMTDOA,B07VGS56Z7,2.0,"Update: The top pair in the 234 was my favorite because it's the most natural looking but after 2 uses, one of the magnets fell off! This brand has quality issues. I decided to order many other brands of magnetic lashes (Newcally, LAMIX, Coolours) and I found that the magnets for the Yiwamica's lashes are considerably weaker. The other brands lashes would pop on and when pulled off would pull my skin a little. This brand's magnets do not do that. I have to press the eyelashes on and then corners would dislodge.  I thought it was due to the liner but no, it's the magnets! Between the magnets falling off completely and the weak magnets, I'm downgrading from 4 to 2 stars.<br /><br />As for the styles, I bought 3 sets from this listing: 230, 231, and 234. See my photo.<br /><br />The 234 is a set of 3 with a natural pair, a denser natural pair same length, and a longest natural pair. The length difference is probably 1mm, very hard to tell on the tray (I didn’t measure with ruler or anything) but you can tell in person when wearing them. I think only the first pair looks truly natural on me for everyday use because I have small Asian hooded eyes. The other two in the 234 tray are sort of natural but I would not use them for day time use.<br /><br />The 231 has 2 pairs that looked the same as the longest pair in the 234 set...again not natural enough for small eyes for day time use.<br /><br />The 230 has crisscrossed lashes where it is longer towards the outer corners and shorter towards the inner. These lashes are longer than those in the 231 and 234.<br /><br />I ended up returning 231 because it was a repeat of my least favorite pair in the 234 set.<br /><br />The 230 box had quality issues. One of the lash strands was super long on one of the lashes. The 230 set was also glued to the plastic holder instead of magnetized to strips on the tray like the other two sets. When I removed the lashes from the holder, the middle magnet fell off 2 of the lashes!<br /><br />I also got a eyeliner and 2 lash pair set from the same company. You can see in my photo. That eye liner turned out to be really bad so I returned that.<br /><br />Instead, I use the Aroama brand of magnetic liner also sold on Amazon (the one with over 1,000 reviews) with these lashes. The magnetics in these lashes are sorta big but since I have to draw the liner really thick for them to stay at all, it’s tough to even notice the magnets. The thick liner could also contribute to the lashes not looking as natural.<br /><br />I want to mention the magnet spacing is inconsistent across this brand. There are always 5 magnets but some are gapped evenly while others you get 2 magnets on each end and one in the middle with a huge gap on each side. The ends of the lashes do tend to detach from the eye easily for me as compared to the middle so the configuration with 2 magnets on the ends helps me. The spacing is purely up to your preference though. Pay attention to the product photos to see which magnet spacing you would get.",True,1,1,1,3

Her normal hair prep time on school mornings is anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes. She uses a flatiron, because the heated brush I got her won't straighten her hair enough. She has to be really careful, and even so has often burned her fingers and the skin around her face trying to straighten the tiny tight pincurls that encircle her face and head. I have been hunting around for a better, faster solution for her and found it in this wonderful salon quality ceramic heated comb by KingdomCare.<br /><br />I was originally going to save it for her birthday in the fall, but seeing her daily struggle with the curly locks I opted for an early gifting. I have to say, and I use my granddaughter's word, this curling comb is “awesome”. I watched her do her hair and noticed that she did not have to use such small segments as she normally does with her flatiron. She was never concerned about her hand getting burned, nor was I. You could touch the outer shell of the heated portion and not be burned. Likewise near the base of the hair, no worries about burning tender facial skin. And the curls disappeared like magic as they skimmed through comb's tines.<br /><br />Additional features I like about this heating comb are the swiveling cord, the six temperature settings (with lighted buttons to let you know how how the setting is), the smooth feel of the surface and the cool pale pink and silver color of the comb as well as the easy grip surface on the handle. There is an on/off button, heat up/down arrows and temperature displays in both fahrenheit and celsius. This curling comb also reaches higher temperatures than other heated brushes. The one I use tops out lower than the lowest temp on this device. That makes this comb particularly great for thick, wavy hair.<br /><br />The ceramic heating elements also do a nice job dealing with fly away hairs and static. My granddaughter is really ecstatic with her new beauty tool and is already anticipating all her friends being jealous and wanting to borrow it from her. I definitely award this straightener five stars. It absolutely lives up to its reputation and does not cost a fortune to own.<br /><br />This item is a discounted sample provided by the vendor for review consideration.",False,1,0,1,2

This has a 30 second (to a minute) fast heating time, three different heat settings, a steam feature, an anti-scalding feature, and constant temperature protection. It also comes with a glove to protect your hand from the heat, a little water bottle thingy for the steam feature (I think), and a hair clip to use while straitening.<br />I really like this.

After that, you use the included scrunchies to hold it in place at the bottom.<br /><br />This sounds all well and good but, maybe it was just me, it was difficult to get my hair twisted correctly onto the rod. My hair is long, reaching about mid back and perfectly straight. If you get it on there right, it comes out looking very nice. It just takes a whole lot of practice. Also, as a side note, if your hair is a little damp, it works better.<br /><br />This comes with the main curler, two large scrunchies, two smaller scrunchies, two hair clips, and a nice bag to keep everything in.

AHTVWPRYBCZFG7SJUZTTN6BTFK7Q,B08PYXKZRS,4.0,"This Melao lavender exfoliant foot peel works very well. The box contains one set of booties for one time use. It’s real simple to use these. You have to start off by cleaning your feet well. It doesn’t hurt to give them a bit of a soak for a time as well beforehand. Just to get them good ready. Next, you place the booties on your feet. It’s recommended that you put socks over the booties to hold them firmly in place since you have to wear them for an hour. I did just that and think that’s a mighty fine recommendation to follow. When that hour is up, you take all that off your feet and give your feet a good washing with soap and water. Now comes the waiting game. At first, I thought they did absolutely nothing.For days, I thought they did nothing. Then, around the 4th/5th day my feet just started to peel. They were shedding skin. It was so weird! They continued to do that for a few days and when it was all over my feet did look and feel really nce for quite some time. Just remember to keep moisturizing to keep them looking and feeling nice for a long time after.<br /><br />The thing about this product is that you can’t expect instant results. It takes a few days and you have to still use the same moisturizers and stuff you were using on your feet, or at least I did. I have really dry feet in spots and I despise it so to have something actually work for a little while was great.

Not really its intended purpose but it does work pretty well in that role as long as you are careful.  Emphasis on the being careful; it can, and will, grab loose skin.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with it.  It cuts through hair quickly and easily making it easy for quick touch up trims.  It's also fairly quiet, much quieter than my electric shaver so it doesn't affect my hearing when trimming sideburns and hair that's grown longer than my ears.  It will also operate in either corded or cordless mode, handy when the battery dies.<br /><br />Only a few negatives from my view:<br />-The charging LED in the handle does not shut off when the unit is charged.  It is lit the entire time it's plugged in.  Little annoying considering almost very rechargeable device will let you know when it has completed charging.<br />- It does not charge at the same time you are using it while plugged in.  Not really a big deal, just something to be aware of.<br />- Only the head portion can be rinsed; the base / battery can not get wet.  Again, not really a big deal.<br />- Hair trimmings get stuck in the lubricant grease inside the head.  Not a lot, only a few very small pieces, but if you're a perfectionist it can be a little aggravating.<br /><br />I'm expecting this will also work well to trim out the tufts of overgrown toe fur that my cat gets.  I can, and do, trim with scissors periodically but it takes a bit of time due to being careful.  The longer it takes the more annoyed he gets.  Using this I should be able to trim the fur much quicker so he gets less annoyed.  Less annoyed cat == less annoyed human.  We both win!<br /><br />Update: Dec 1, 2010<br />15 months later and I'm still using this.  Does a fantastic job of keeping the hair around my ears trimmed just enough so that it isn't touching or rubbing.  Very quick and quiet.  It still irks me a little bit that it doesn't tell you when charging is complete.  The other nitpicks I've gotten over.<br /><br />I can't say how well it works on trimming toe fur on a long haired cat.

I have tried every single product I could get my hands on to clear up an ongoing infection on my neck that put me in the emergency room. I thought it was shingles and was even diagnosed as such. The Doctors gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way.  Over a year later, whatever it is/was kept on spreading. I have dealt with this nightmare and it has consumed my life and sent me into a terrible depression. My skin was itching, my neck would burn if I turned it too much, it was sore all the time and I would get these constant breakouts, like acne but I knew they were not acne. I have never felt so miserable.<br /><br />In the past  I have tried turmeric (internally and as a mask), green tea, sulfur, benzoyl peroxide, pro-biotics, internal oregano, tea tree oil, manuka oil, manuka honey, antibiotics, changing my entire diet to eat healthy and lots of fruit and vegetables... The list goes on and on and not one thing helped. Not ONE!<br /><br />Then, about a month ago, I was researching folliculitis and many of the symptoms matched what was going on with me. I do not remember how I stumbled upon this soap but I thought, what the hell. I tried everything else, lets see if this does ANYTHING at all.

AHZVOJZLY67N32CZ5DHBIUYV72JA,B094PZNFKG,4.0,"This wig looks really cute, and I was able to get it to mostly blend with my natural gray hair around my face and with my widow's peak, which is pretty hard to blend in with a lot of wigs. I don't like to use any kind of glue or tape, so I depend on a wig grip and bobby pins to hold everything in place. This fit my head pretty well, and I have an average size head, but I think slightly larger heads would fit too. I'm not sure it would do too well if you have really long and thick hair, as it might take up too much space in the cap. When I had it on, I didn't notice the tracks, but when it was off I thought they were pretty noticable, and I was a little worried. Also you know how on some wigs, they add those short annoying hairs that inevitably end up poking through the longer ones and looking weird? Yep, I noticed the hair towards the back of the cap does that. Coincidentally, that's the place where the tracks are most visible as well.<br />The thing I like about it, is the actual hair, and the color, the texture, and the ability to flip it from side to side (even though it's parted in the middle. The style of it is most like my natural hair of any wig that I've purchased so far. I did add some dry shampoo. The color looks really awesome indoors. Outside in the daylight, it is a little much. It looks pretty white outdoors, but has a nice silvery-gray color indoors. So there are some negatives, but I could see wearing this as a daily wear wig. It didn't tangle too badly after a full day of wear... even with me running my fingers through it and flipping it like I do. I was easily able to tidy it up by finger combing at the end of the day. I wish the back side was slightly longer because the front that frames your face is longer and the waves in the back can look a little shaggy compared to the slightly curlier waves in the front. Overall, it's still cute, but I think the price is too much for this short wig. It should be closer to the $20 range. I'd love to own a 22-24"" version of this in the same color or even a slightly darker gray or gray mix.",True,1,0,1,2

The powder goes on very smooth and effortlessly. In earlier reviews it states that this doesn't have good coverage, but it's a contour palette, it isn't meant to cover anything. I don't need to use much of the powder for it to show on my skin, I definitely don't want &#34;harsh contour lines&#34; so I only use about 3 brush strokes of each color.

Once you gently unfold it you peel off the first layer.  Then apply to the face and after doing so peel off the outside cover.  It is much easier if you pull out the eye holes and mouth hole before placing on your face.  It does have a fair amount of staying power once it’s in place for a minute.

AFFZBI7Z7IE66YKKMUOYMNEENWAQ,B008A12F36,3.0,"I have very dense, thick, and long 4C hair, so my texture is the most coarse texture of hair to possibly test the durability of this blower-dryer comb.  Anyone that has coarse or thick hair such as yours truly, likely runs into the same problem as me when you blow dry your hair after a washing. The dang blow-dryer comb keeps popping off and/or the teeth bends and snaps off. So annoying!  Since this is very expensive for a blow-dryer comb, I'm sure ladies will appreciate this critical review before purchasing.  Here are the pros and cons I've come across.<br /><br />Pros...The material is the highest grade of plastic (not at all rubber) I have seen in a blow-dryer comb.  It appears to be equivalent to the &#34;plastic&#34; material cooking utensils are made of, so the teeth does not easily bend/break.  The finer and less dense your hair is, the longer the life-time you will have this comb.  If you attach it securely, the comb actually works without popping off.<br /><br />Cons...This seems to only work for dryers with a narrow barrel, and not so much for the dryers that has a bubble shape.  It will pop off dryers with a bubble shaped barrel, because it will be impossible to secure it on a nozzle tip that is not cylinder-shaped.  All you need is a phillips screwdriver to attach it. Since I have 4C hair, I did actually notice slight bending of a couple teeth, and the bending increased after a 3rd usage.  After my 3rd hair drying, I tried to hand-bend the teeth back in place, and 2 snapped off!  $40 bucks (cost and shipping) down the drain :-(  Also, what you don't know until you see it in person is that there is a metal bar inside the comb, that is being raked against your hair as you are combing it, which will eventually cause heat damage with prolonged usage, especially if you dry your hair on high.<br /><br />My overall assessment is that, yes it worked better that expected.  Although 2 teeth broke on mine and others slightly bent, I plan on buying another one to have on-hand, as I currently have not come across any better options.  But, I'm going to take a break from this comb for a while, and try drying my hair with a paddle brush and my dryer because the thought of that metal bar inside the Willie Morrow comb, raking against my hair with every usage is alarming, and will surely heat damage my hair.",True,1,1,1,3

I did resolve this a bit by adding some of mouthwash to each tank of water before I use it, however I can not use it without adding the mouthwash because it makes the water taste terrible and did want to be able to use it with only plain water.<br /><br /> Secondly, it is rechargeable, but only via a USB connection, not a standard &#34;home&#34; electrical out as I had I expected (NOTE:  It says it's 120/240V compatible) which is why I thought it would be charged via a standard electrical outlet versus a USB Port.  USB is okay for those who own computers, (I do), but we certainly don't keep our computer in the bathroom.  I have to charge it in my office, which is a bit inconvenient for a bathroom product.<br /><br />On the upside, it does work pretty well, once you can get used the the water taste and it's nice that the are three settings.

One full tank is not enough to clean all my teeth, even on the &#34;pulse&#34; setting.<br /><br />Overall, it's okay and does serve the purpose, but would be MUCH better if it did not make the water have the awful &#34;plastic&#34; taste and if the take was larger.

Unfortunately I was only able to get 4 small tattoos out of the entire pack. Printing was relatively simple and the ink did not run or bleed out. I used photo quality and matte paper for my settings.<br /><br />The issue is with the adhesive. For the tattoos to work you have to first print the item on the paper; then using the clear adhesive sheet cover the tattoo. All the clear sheet is used for is a transfer medium to move the adhesive onto the image. Where I ran into the problem was getting the adhesive film to release from the plastic sheet and remain on the image. Separating the image side and the clear plastic sheeting resulted in varied degrees of torn images, half the adhesive sticking, or the entire image sticking to the clear sheet<br /><br />One tip would be to have someone hold down the adhesive/image side as you remove the clear backing. This has its own set of problems since the adhesive side sticks to your hand and gets stretched out or bubbles up.<br /><br />In summary the idea is great but the adhesive needs to release from its medium easier to make the product more user friendly.",True,1,0,1,2

I thought she was crazy! This was like 10 years ago. I never heard of such a thing and I didn't do it. Well I don't know what happened recently for this to suddenly now become popular. One of my friends and I were talking about lash extensions and lattisse. I was telling her how my eye lids turn red when i try to use lattisse. I even tried the RF brand and same thing! Anyhows, then i've been doing exentions for about a year now but I am finding that my lash is getting worst and worst.. like when my extensions fall out, I barely have lashes! I used to have average lash that  I could curl. But now it seems like I barely have anything. So this is why I decided to finally consider perming my lash. So perming the did not make it longer by any means! What it did though is made it look like I had lashes that were longer but it curved up! My lash tends to grow straight. It may have have to do with the fact that I have asian eyes. So the curling has always been important when I used to wear mascara. The thing is I hate that sometimes it poked at me and the curler would yank some lashes out!  Also I just hate it doing it every day. With perm lashes, you don't have to do this. However, I don't know if I could have done this alone. I had to get a friend to help me. She said it was pretty easy. What took the longest is us reading things over and over to make sure we weren't going to make me blind! I think it took about an hour or so? I can't recall exactly as we didn't time it.

While this seems like it would be better, in reality is that means you need to commit to using all 12 slices of fruit in one go because there isn’t an easy way to reseal the mask package.

The wig has a track seperating the frontal from the sewn bundles which is irritating because the part isnt that long which leaves me with the only option; remove it or monitor whether its showing or not which is uncomfortable bc a wig shouldnt expose you. This irritates me BIG !!!!<br />The frontal of the wig is whispy and not as full as the back. Im not sure if its the humidity outside or not but I flatironed it this morning and it looks more of a body wave in the front and straight in the back.

I do understand that they make them to where they can be adjusted to the customers liking abd or big head friendly bc everyones head comes in different sizes but I struggled today lol. I reconstructed the whole wig in the back. I took four tracks out the back and cut the comb out and replaced it to help on the track line and sewed it through the cap for the much needed support. I had to cut the sides down as well bc it was really bulky. I sewed the band that came with the wig into the wig as well to hold the bulkeness down more. When I say I was tired I was but all in all I like it better now, my head is just small. Hopefully I can figure this seperatung track out. I may just use this wig when I want to pull the hair up or something bc I cant be worried about this. 😬 Im not sure of anyone else experienced this with their purchase, but it may have been just mine.

I haven't noticed any shedding and I only needed to use 3 pieces since I was only trying to add a little length. The clips are very secure feeling in my hair & it was super easy to install myself. I am definitely a newbie to hair extensions so if you're nervous about being able to do this yourself, don't be!! I will say the hair did smell like burnt hair.

AEKURCC5QNLDUOA2HWRKW3MCO43A,B0009MFUOA,4.0,"I agree with most of the other reviews.  This is the best electric shaver I've ever had--lightyears better than the Braun Syncro I was using before.  I don't expect to get as close a shave with an electric as with a blade, so I don't think it's fair to judge them by that standard; the only thing that makes sense is to compare them to other electrics, and this one is outstanding.  It's quiet, it charges quickly, and it shaves your beard.  I like products I don't have to think about.<br /><br />I'm not pleased by the fact that this model doesn't have a low-battery indicator.  That's a demerit.  The stand is a little gimmicky.  You can charge the unit without using the stand; the stand just makes the product look a bit more pretentious.  (My shaver came with a free ""personal groomer"" for beards as well as ear and nose hair; this was a nice addition, but not enough to make or break the sale.)<br /><br />Lastly, to the guy who had a hassle at Target: don't blame the product for the fact that you don't like Target's return policy.",False,1,1,0,2

AFPFNE3NNU3DPH75PTZR4TEBYGOQ,B07KXVGHTV,3.0,"I bought 2 of these.  One for myself and one for my Mom.  My Mom liked it but I did not.  I have always used wooden back brushes with natural bristles but decided to try a plastic one to see if it would last longer.  I have never liked nylon bristles and sometimes they irritate my skin.  The description said that the bristles on this brush were boar bristles.<br /><br />First problem I noticed was the handle was shorter than I was used to.  I am a short average build guy and I have some difficulty reaching my entire back easily with it.  Second issue, the bristles are some sort of soft plastic not boar as advertised.  The bristles are tightly packed which is nice but very soft.  They didn't irritate my skin like some but the softness left me questioning how clean my back was getting.  The tightly packed bristles seem like a great feature but after you use it a couple of times you realize that it makes air tough to get through the bristles so the brush takes longer to dry than most.  If you don't really sling the remaining water out of them and/or pat down with a cloth the brush may still be damp the next time you go to use it which doesn't seem hygienic.  The last issue I have with this back brush is there are no grips or non-slip material where you hold it.  It can become kind of slippery and cumbersome when the handle gets wet.<br /><br />This does seem to be a well made brush that should last a long time, it just wasn't for me.  It is definitely better than the the plastic back brushes you find in most retail stores.  My Mom loves it.  She kept hers and I was easily able to get return authorization through Amazon with no issues for mine.  Going back to a wooden natural bristle brush.  Sometimes it's better to stick with what you know.",True,1,1,1,3
AFMRVCOSOWIVMBRPJFCAL54EB5NA,B000GBMYC0,1.0,"If you've been reading any of the reviews here lately you will know the 8000 series foil/cutterblock combo has been replaced with a new combo now called the series 5 Combi 51S.  You will receive this replacement even if the picture on the product page shows ""8000 series"" as it has been discontinued for over a year.  Braun merged the replacement for the 8000 series (Activator) with the 360 Complete.  This new foil/cutterblock is garbage!  The cutterblock has wide blades, as opposed to the thinner blades of the original 8000 series, which pull your stubble and take MANY passes over your face to shave.  They are prone to premature failure and I have gone through 3(THREE) of these in 6 months!  (I bought one and two were free through Braun after complaining).  All the free replacements in the world weren't making the shaving experience any better.  I longed for the days when my Activator 8595 cut smooth, close, and comfortably.  After all, this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far!  I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review.  It worked PERFECTLY!  The 7000 series replacement looks just like the much coveted original on my 8595 Activator - down to the thinner cutting blades!  It didn't pull my stubble, it cut smooth as butter, and was comfortable: JUST LIKE NEW!  I'd like to thank the original reviewer (James L. Walls ""sixtoe"") for the very good advice.<br /><br />***Update: August 10th, 2011***<br />I hope people are happy with the replacement I recommended.  I sure am!  I just wanted to update the product link for the better replacement: [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]]<br /><br />***Update: January 13, 2013***<br />Unfortunately, the Braun 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack is now the same terrible cutter block design as the series 5 (8000 replacement).  I ordered another 30B to replace the one I bought 2.5 years ago and was highly disappointed when the package came.  I will have to do some research to see if any of Braun's other replacements are the good, narrow blade versions.  I have read some reports that the narrow cutting block is available, but without the foil.  If I cannot find a narrow blade replacement I am going to throw in the towel after 8 years of service from this shaver.  Shame on Braun for putting out those ill performing wide blade cutting blocks.  Terrible...<br /><br />***Update: January 18, 2013***<br /><br />It appears the highly elusive narrow blade cutter block can be found on the 31S replacement pack.  The unfortunate news is the included foil is not compatible.  Therefore, a replacement foil for the 8000 series/Activator/7000 series/360 Complete would be needed in conjunction with the quality cutter block effectively doubling your cost because it is difficult to find the foil sold by itself.  This would be a combined expense of roughly $55-$60 in order to bring your shaver back to the ""like new"" shave we all want.  Remember - the ""direct"" replacement combo for this shaver series will leave you highly disappointed due to the WIDE cutter block which pulls hair and easily nicks skin.  Another facet to influence your decision in spending $60 to refresh your Braun is many of these shavers - due to their age - are in need of new motors and potentially batteries.  The motors gradually slow down with time and I noticed a HUGE difference when I replaced mine 2 years ago.  Now, these motors are almost impossible to find at this point and for me, personally, it is getting to the point of diminished returns.  I hope this post helps you in both informing you of the available narrow cutter block, but also in weighing your decision in either keeping your Braun chugging along or researching a new alternative.",False,1,1,1,3

Even though i have been using it for 2.5 years I have seen very little difference.  After i have it on for 3 hours my penis looks longer flaccid for a few minutes because it had been stretched out. Within a few minute it reverts back to its tiny size. When erect I can honestly say I dont see any difference at all.  It hurts if you put it on incorrectly and can be very fiddly.  For men who have a smaller head it is very difficult for the contraption to stay on as it continually slips off.  I only use it when i am in bed or at home.  A few times i wore it to work and within 30 min of arrival i had to take it off because it started hurting really bad.  The logic behind the contraption seems to make sense , stretch the skin to produce more cellular structure, but that takes time even years to work.  I have not given up on the contraption and I am still using it 3 hours a day. I am sure if i used it longer hours it may work quicker but for me after 3 hours My penis just cant take the pain anymore.  Good luck guys.",False,1,1,1,3

It does seem to make my hair soft, too.<br />The bad - While soft, it almost gives my hair too much volume or something? (I have fine hair but a lot of it.) Anytime I use it, I end up with all sorts of cowlicks and hair sticking up in odd ways no matter if it's styled or air dried. Thought it was just my hair at first but this only happens when using this shampoo. Finally, the bottle that was sent ended up having some weird manufacturing defect where the top wont stay shut.

It specifically says to avoid acetone but I used pure acetone to clean them which worked fine EXCEPT that it stripped the paint off the handle of the brushes.

So if you are looking for immediate results, I recommend Shouvy's BB whitening cream with SPF30; it is a cosmetic lotion which gives instant whitening but does not physically alter skin tone.<br /><br />This is a blend of effective natural whitening agents with additional properties beneficial for skin.  These ingredients have been demonstrated to even skin tone, lighten hyperpigmentation, build collagen and inhibit the production of melanin. The skin lightening agents in this product are as follows. Google each for further information, but in brief summary:<br /><br />Glutathione has been called the mother of all anti-oxidants. Clinical research has shown glutathione significantly lowers the skin's melanin content in as little as 10 weeks.<br /><br />Kojic acid is derived from mushrooms, used as a skin lightening agent because it inhibits the protein tyrosinase from producing melanin. Kojic acid alone has shown effects faster than most other lightening agents, beginning at about 6 weeks.<br /><br />Even faster is Artocarpus Lakoocha Heartwood extract. Used alone, it has shown significant whitening effect after only 4 weeks of application.<br /><br />Coenzyme Q10 aka ubiquinone is a chemical substance naturally produced by our own cells. Applied topically, it can help lighten freckles, age spots, acne scars, and other discolourations. Q10 may also help enhance regeneration of skin cells, thereby reducing the appearance of wrinkles.<br /><br />Vitamin C provides surprisingly high level lightening and increased UV protection while helping to fade sun/age spots and freckles. Vitamin C is also proven to boost glutathione levels which further helps lighten skin. It also enhances collagen synthesis and increases cell turnover, which makes it a popular ingredient in anti-aging serums.<br /><br />All together this should be effective in treating melasma (dark pigmentation), acne scars, freckles and age spots.  The company does not mention SPF but the inclusion of titanium dioxide, coenzyme Q10  and vitamin C would be expected to provide some degree of UV protection.<br /><br />Before applying whitening lotion, you should perform a patch test. This is a good practice before using any skin care product, but especially those containing parabens. (common allergen) Just dab a little on your wrist or inner elbow and wait a few minutes. If you experience any signs of irritation such as redness, itch, or swelling, of course discontinue use.<br /><br />My skin is somewhat pale, but tans easily, so I always have one arm darker than the other simply from being exposed to sunlight in the car. I will conduct an experiment using this lotion on the one arm only, and report my findings. Whitening creams do require several weeks to produce results, and the effect increases over time. For now I can only say that it goes on smooth and silky and has a pleasant scent.<br /><br />***EDIT - I've now been using this product for several months, and just raised my rating from 3 stars to 4. Yes this lotion actually does work. Not surprising, with those ingredients. If you don't mind using a product that physically alters your skin's production of melanin, and are willing to use this daily, it will absolutely lighten your complexion a shade or two. Just be patient and give it two or three months to achieve full lightening potential.",False,1,1,1,3

The clay crusts over and the pump gets stuck. 1 you only end up getting one small pump out of it and 2 the hole where the product release has clumpy dried up clay too and clogs super easy so not much comes out without poking a hole in it first.

AG4OLRLGKNT5IIAQMHBTXJY4BEDA,B01DNALWVE,1.0,I really wanted to love the Kylie polishes. I bought several different colors and the top coat. First..it fits not go on smooth like the other sinful colors. It's a bit chunky. I thought it might be a bad bottle but it's all of them that have any sparkle to them. After about 2 strokes on the mail it gets thick and stringy like old nail polish. Does not go on smooth or even. Not even after 2 coats. When using the step 2 top coat if your color isn't 100 percent dry it will pull the color off.  It takes an incredibly long time to dry.  And when your finally ready to remove....make sure you have time. I tried every method...leaving the cotton ball soaked on my nail for 3-5 minutes did little to speed the process. I had to file down the top coat to get the remover to penetrate and it still took tons of friction and remover to remove. It took me over 20 minutes just to remove the polish. The colors are gorgeous but it needs some work on the formula.,False,1,0,1,2

I first began using hyaluronic acid serum (another brand) a couple months ago and I was getting low on my bottle so I decided to give this one a try. I love that there are only three ingredients in the bottle, but I can see how the labeling &#34;pure hyaluronic acid &#34; could be misleading. It also contains water and benzyl alcohol. This serum is really refreshing and I use it every night on my face and neck. You can use it morning and night, but I just chose to apply it before bed. I pour about a third of a dropper full into my hand and rub it in gently. I have severely dry skin and it has helped keep the dryness and flakes at bay, which is wonderful. It recommends just using 1-2 drops, but that would probably work for someone who does not have really dry skin like I do. The bottle it comes in is glass and it comes with a nice glass dropper as well. The serum is clear and does not have any smell. The reason I cannot give five stars is because it is a little bit more watery than the hyaluronic acid I was using previously, so I believe this one is diluted down a bit. But, with that being said, this brand is also cheaper in price. I am happy with it and will continue using it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Over recent months, as I grew my goatee longer, I started noticing some flakiness on my chin (always clean and well groomed), and that my beard hairs were becoming drier and stiff. It seems time is against me, as the gray hairs in my beard are noticeably stiffer and scratchier. After reading reviews of several products, I chose the Fragrance Free Beardsmen Beard Oil. I didn't want any scent that would compete with anything else I chose to wear. I specifically chose Beardsmen after comparing ingredients with other brands. Formulations were similar, all using several types of natural oils to create a moisturizing product. Two things convinced me to try Beardsmen. First, the quantity. For less money than some other products, Beardsmen offers a much larger quantity of oil than pretty much anyone, so they definitely win the &#34;bang for the buck&#34; award. Second, Beardsmen is the only one that has a flow controlling dispenser, so you don't have to mess with ridiculous eye droppers and such. Oh... and the product itself? I LOVE it. No more flaky chin skin, and my beard is soft and smooth. This is obviously a plus as far as my wife is concerned. There is only the very slightest hint of a light &#34;oil&#34; smell when you first put it on, which is not strong enough be more than barely noticeable for a second or two, and definitely would never be noticed by others.

I was so upset when it was discontinued.<br />That said, my nostalgia got the best of me when I saw this on Amazon. I don’t recall what the original Candies smelled like, so its hard to say how close this is to the OG formulation, but this one smells really sweet. My initial response to it was “aqua net hairspray with citrus magic”. It is very ‘orangey’, and the citrus is huge here.<br />Once the hairspray smell goes away, it smells rather nice. It doesn’t smell expensive, you can tell it’s not a high end fragrance, but it’s nice. I wouldn’t buy another bottle, though. Same thing with the Candies Black (which I also bought- blindly). I wouldn’t renew either of these, but it was not a waste. They smell “OK” enough to wear out, and the projection is intense. These “new” Candies frags will make people around you get a headache, if you take a bath in them. A few sprays is literally all you need. Both are extremely strong, and the scent lasts a while on the skin, and a very long time on clothing.<br />It has a little bit of a gourmand thing going on after it dries...it smells like lemans and oranges. I suppose wanting to eat it is why it’s called “Candies”, so in that regard, kudos.<br />There’s something going on beneath all the citrus, but I cannot for the life of me put my finger on it.<br />Just know this is very sweet, like Invuctus, but “cheaper” smelling.

Inside, it contains the blue Jaw Exerciser, anda laynard. Inside the Dollar Store-style plastic bag, there's nothing else. I was trying to figure out where does the laynard go, typically lanyards go inside a tiny holes, for example, on a smartphone. Since there's neither any ""tiny"" holes anywhere nor instructions, I went back to the product page, and looked at the product page photos, so the lanyard goes into the HUGE opening in the center of the Jaw Exerciser. This is nice, since this permits you to hang the Jaw Exerciser while it's not in use, instead of putting inside my pants pockets which is full of dirt & lint, probably not the best place. NOW, the only thing to try out is:<br />🤔🤔🤔🤔does this thing actually WORK?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔<br /><br />Well, you first should put the Jaw Exerciser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to soften it, and then after removing the protecting strips, you'd bite down to put pressure and allow the "" softened"" device to be molded according to your individual jawline, which will make the Jaw exercises more effective.<br /><br />I've been trying it for the last 2-3 months, while it's better than nothing - the Jaw muscles are probably the most neglected and difficult to exercise on a regular basis. So, for that purpose, ANY exercise is a plus, however, if you TOTALLY depend your double chins be gone on this gadget, you'd be drastically disappointed 😞☹️😞☹️☹️ Simply, it's a supplement to Health Diet, Regular Exercises, and Sleep Well, that's the ONLY way to burn fat, and eliminating double chins, this or ANY Jaw Exerciser is just a gimmick gadget.<br /><br />☹️😟🙄👎Not Recommended👎☺️☺️😟",False,1,1,1,3

Hence, I practice my daily skincare regimen religiously! My daily skincare regimen includes using serums, moisturizers, oils, eye creams. Sometimes I indulge in a spritz of Rosewater for refreshment.<br /><br />Now I use my face serums to do two things. First, of course, is for the benefit to my skin; and the various serums produce different effects simply because they consist of different main ingredients. Most all of them help protect against environmental contaminants, help reduce the appearance of lines, and some even help dark spots to lighten. Merlot Sunrise Serum uses natural grape seed antioxidants as its main active ingredient. (If you check the Merlot skincare line website, you'll see that their focus is on the use of grape seed antioxidants in all of their products.)<br /><br /> My second use is my own personal ""spa"" massage. I literally massage the serum into my skin. I focus on my temples, forehead, jaw line, nasal bridge, between eyes, and crows feet areas. I apply a firm, upward rotating massage with my splayed fingers. I thoroughly believe this helps me to relax, relieves tension, and massages the lymph system to aid in drainage. I just feel this is good for me. I even do this more than once a day when I have a headache or a particularly stressful day. This will work with most any serum.<br /><br />It works well with the Merlot Sunrise Serum because it in itself is refreshing, a light hint of ""fresh air"" scent, and literally feels good on my skin.<br /><br />The recommended use is twice daily - morning and evening - on cleansed skin.

Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Crystal Lemon Face Lift Tape』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a ‘band-aid solution to a mature face’. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial ‘tape’ that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face.

They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough.

As for use on the rest of my face, again it was quite effective. Just out of curiosity, after cleansing with the C'est Moi, I did a second once over with a cotton ball soaked in Micellar Water - my face was already completely clean; no makeup had been left on my face at all, but I did feel that there was a slight residue sitting on my skin.

I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be selective.  First impressions: It is a very sleek and cool looking razor.  It is so fancy, that I am afraid of breaking it every time I touch it.  The problem with this razor is not its performance, rather it is the maintenance.  The lotion is expensive, and to make things worse, it is nearly impossible to find, unless you are willing to spend lots of money and buy it online.  But, the razor works, so I stuck it out.<br /><br />Next problem: Norelco suggests that you replace the cartridge for sanitary reasons each time you refill the lotion.  OK, but when I ordered the lotion (which is supposed to come with the cartridge), THERE WAS NO CARTRIDGE!  So, I decided to stick it out anyway.  Each time I replaced the lotion, I would just remove the cartridge and clean it myself.  That seemed fine, until this morning when I accidentally broke a piece of this fragile cartridge.  Now, I can't get the lotion to come out, so the razor is ineffective.  I tried to buy a new lotion with cartridge at Target, and the lotion came without the cartridge, so I have to return it.<br /><br />I know Phillips-Norelco has excellent customer service, so I called to see if they could help me.  It turns out that the lotion does not always come with the cartridge (although it is advertised that way and I was told that it came with the cartridge by a customer service rep before I bought the razor).  So, it's kind of like a little guessing game.  Where can I find the lotion and cartridge together?  Fun!  I asked if they could just send me some cartridges, no lotion, just cartridges and I'd be happy.  But they could not do that, so I am going to return this razor and get my money back.<br /><br />I still have a previous Norelco shaver (dry) and I will try that again, although it is not as good.  I think in the end I may have to resort back to the painful manual razor shave.  I have been a Norelco customer for many years and up to this point I was always very pleased, this is disappointing.<br /><br />To summarize: This is an excellent razor, but it is not worth the money or the hassle you have to go through to make it work effectively!<br /><br />I welcome any shaving advice to help my sensitive skin!",True,1,1,1,3

It appears you can heat two cartridges at the same time and I'm ecstatic about that.<br /><br />The wax it came with went on smooth and to my surprise only needed one more application to remove my underarm hair. Put a little baby powder under your arm prior to waxing as this will create a smoother process and absorb any oil and moisture. With the Nair Roll On Wax, I sometimes had to do three to four applications to get all the hair and ya know that's not good for your skin when you're waxing.<br /><br />Now for the one star deduction.....I went back and forth with whether I should give 5 stars or 4 stars but I think 4 stars is still pretty darn good. The reason for this is the time it takes to heat the wax up. It took mine 25 minutes. That can seem like a long time when you're used to putting wax in the microwave and it's ready under 2 minutes. It's only a minor issue however the system definitely makes up for this plus you can order more cartridges in different scents.<br /><br />Overall, great buy and you won't regret it. If you were a Nair Roll On Hair Remover fan like I was, you can kiss the days of paying for overpriced Nair rollers on Amazon goodbye, since they've discontinued it and third party sellers are trying to make an insane profit.<br /><br />Edit to add......so apparently the pink one cannot be attached to the extra outlet. That outlet is for a different voltage but what the heck, I ordered it anyway. Can't go wrong with more than one hair removal system. I'll do a separate review on that one once I get it.",True,1,0,1,2

It makes sense to have a thick line for the Eyelashes to adhere to.<br /><br />The only issue I had with this Eyelash kit, was the Eyeliner. It dries too quickly and the instructions say to apply the Eyelashes while it is still wet. This makes it difficult to get a good smooth line and apply quickly. It takes some getting used too.<br />I ended up applying my normal liquid liner, then going over it with the Magnetic Liner to get a more even look.<br />I do suggest giving a good amount of application to the Eyeliner to reassure they are secure.<br /><br />The Removing Process definitely takes some time. You really have to soak your Eyelashes with remover to get all of the sticky pieces of Magnetic Eyeliner off.<br /><br />All in all, they are good Magnetic Eyelashes. I would definitely recommend them.

AH2FEFQOVLI6GKPS2YBAWRMYVJ3Q,B016OBD4Q0,5.0,"This review is for the 3 Pack (White/Slate/Lake blue) of the Niutop Watchband Style Band for Fitbit One. I received a promotional discount on this item in exchange for providing a review. I have been using this item daily for a little over a month and wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />First Impressions<br />* The items were exactly as pictured, the colors really bright and crisp.<br />* It took some work getting the FitBit One in and out of the band. It gets a little easier the more you use it. I do not view this as a problem as I know its not going to fall out.<br />* Was not easy to insert the fasteners on the one end of the band to the connectors on the other. This is still and issue, but again, I do not view this as a negative as I can trust that it will remain secure, but it can be a pain, easier with help, to fasten it.<br /><br />Observations from wearing.<br />* The FitBit One was very secure in the band, never worried nor experienced it falling out, coming loose, etc.<br />* Once fastened securely the band never unsnapped by accident.<br />* After the first week or so I started to get a rash on my wrist. I switched it to the other wrist and experienced the same thing. I took off the band, removed the FitBit, then washed the band in soap and water. I wore it for several weeks after this, on the same wrist, and did not experience any issues.<br />* I was used to clipping my FitBit to my pocket or shirt, and do not normally wear a watch. I did not have any problem wearing it, was very comfortable and often forgot I even had it on. It did take some getting used to, remember to remove for a shower, and not getting it overly wet while washing my hands, but I got used to it very quickly.<br />* I did notice a few occasions that if I made exaggerated arm movements it would trigger as steps on my FitBit one.<br /><br />Overall<br />I would recommend this for anyone looking for a watchband style carry for their FitBit. I use mine daily and I not even considered going back to clip style carry. I do recommend that when you first receive it that you wash it with soap and water, rinse and let dry before using. You will never need to worry about the FitBit becoming unsecured from the band.",False,1,0,1,2

AGWDTL7Y76LOR4SKWCQULZ2BBBJA,B000UJZIEY,5.0,"I have used electric razors for over 35 years all have good points and all have weaknesses.  Norelco razors have two problems.<br /><br /> Hard to clean.  As the cutter and blades fill up the motor is not able to maintain the speed and nicks result.  You must take the blade and cutter assembly apart to clean properly and if you cut longer hairs by accident(side burn area etc.) it will wrap around the cutting blade and really slow the motor down. The motor slowing is the worst on the new ""3 blade"" called the Speed XL, they just seem to be underpowered.(just as a note the older Spectra blade replacements fit these razors and seem to work better).  Think of this problem like a paper shredder that has not beeen emptied and hasn't room for more papers in the bin.<br /><br />Hidden Build up. I have changed batteries in several of my Norelco shavers and the build up of gunk where only disassembly could find and cure it, is remarkable(same with most brands).  I suspect this is gunk is high in bacteria and the cause of most skin infections from nicks.  The stuff you never knew was there is nasty!<br /><br />Now for the cure: Norelco 8060x!  This razor blade assembly has open backs for the stubble to fall through as you shave. I use mine in the shower so no mess.  The blade assembly is completely seperate from the motor unit= no place for gunk to build up! The unit is entirely water proof.  The blades disassemble easily so you can get at those occasional ""longer hairs"" that wrap around the cutters. The cutters have more blades on each, so the shave is faster and the motor seems stronger than previous models, hence less slowing.  The Nivea solution is great, but you can use regular shave cream or gel.  I like the Nivea Gel for Sensitive Skin, it seems to be the right thickness for the razor and works alomost as well as the cream you load in the razor.<br /><br />The only negative for some people might be the size or shape of the handle, it is smaleer and lighter than most shavers.  Some people with larger hands may find is inconvient and others may find it easy to drop.<br /><br />Overall this is the best all around razor I have owned, there is a brief time required for your face to get used to any new razor...

It does, at least for me. I'm careful to treat my facial skin with care and good products, and while I know you cannot really stop the aging process, you can both plump up and repair dry and irritated skin.<br /><br />This product does all of that. It contains some things you've probably heard about -- reservatrol, which does help rejuvenate, a concentration of an ingredient found in red wine, something of a miracle product in itself. Then there's hempseed oil which calms irritated skin and St. John's Wort, a venerable ingredient know as well to sooth and heal.<br /><br />I wash my hands well, then my face and pat it dry. I drip a little serum in my palm (not touching the dropper so I don't contaminate the product in the jar), dip in lightly with the tips of the fingers of my other hand, and lightly massage it over my face.

I completed the clean by cleaning the tool and razor after each and every tile that was scraped making sure that no moisture stayed on the device or blade as that is what mainly cause the issues however I did have to eventually go out and buy a more rugged blade holder as the mechanical part to remove the blades and to slide the blade in and out of it malfunctioned quite often and eventually both broke.. only 1 razor blade actually ever broke which means that I still think that getting so many decent blades at this price made it worth it even though the tools broke.

AFGJDWPC3FIRG3WVH3ANYZM4HQIA,B01GU9TE56,5.0,"I admit that I felt silly buying this...but I HATE to blow-dry my hair because I have very thick, wavy, and frizz-prone hair.  So usually when I blow-dry it, I can't use the brush properly like a hairdresser would to really work the frizz out and dry it properly and it ends up look dry and poofy until the next day when it settles down.  I typically let my hair just wet-dry and then style with some cream and a curling iron to smooth my ends.  But when I saw this, I just had to try it despite having a small bathroom and thinking &#34;do you really want that thing hanging on you wall?&#34;  The answer is...&#34;Not really, but I really want a free hand to dry my hair.&#34;<br /><br />So I bought it. Although I was still really unsure about the safety of sectioning this thing to my wall.  I imagined it crashing down and smashing my toiletries, injuring the cat, or crashing onto someone's head.  I wondered why I decided to buy it.  But then I received it in the mail, opened it, and was really surprised at how incredibly heavy and solid this thing is.  Everytime I buy a product that is supposed to &#34;suction&#34; and be strong....it isn't.  Well, this one is REALLY strong.<br /><br />I first tested it by suctioning it to the wall (not the mirror as shown in the ad) and left it there for about 2 days just to see if there was any sliding, slipping, or loosening.  I pulled HARD on it various ways to try to get it to fall down.  This thing is 100% solid and the suction is super-strong.  If it stuck to my painted wall, this would never come off a mirror!  Then after I inspected it a good bit, bent the arm around, tried out the bungee, and figured out which way the holder that the blow-dryer goes in is supposed to go....I placed my hair dryer in it.  I had a hard time, at first getting my dryer to fit because I still had the holder upside down.  If the large bolt is pressing against the back of your dryer, it's upside down and it won't seat properly and the bungee will be super-hard to clip (or not at all).  So I was like &#34;great this thing doesn't fit my dryer&#34;.  But you have to twist and move it around to figure out which way yours fits and then it's all pretty much smooth sailing from there.<br /><br />The &#34;arm&#34; that bends is also really hard to bend and very solid and thick.  Merely bumping it (which I did several times), walking into it, or yanking your dryer around doesn't make this flop around.  It requires two hands to bend and stays firmly in whatever position you place it for drying.  Keep in mind this means that other than minor adjustments, if you need to totally change the dryer position while drying...you will need to take a second to move the arm and reposition it a bit, which is not a one-handed job.  I really like that about this.  When I finally tried using it after my shower (after days of leaving it hang up to ensure it doesn't fall, playing around with it, and letting my family get used to it being in their way because of our small bathroom) I was delighted that when I moved the dryer lower to blow straight at me....it stayed firmly in place, even after accidentally slapping it with my hairbrush and hands several times.  I moved it into a &#34;downward&#34; blowing position about halfway through to get the back and was able to not only use a brush and my hands like a normal person, but I noted that I was able to get my hair dry in half the normal time (I assume because of extra brushes and hands).  My hair even looked less frizzy and more like what it should look like after I go to the salon!  My significant other came home and laughed when he saw me awkwardly using it and trying to position it right....but he thinks it's cool, too.<br /><br />It made my life much easier and really DOES function like a permanent fixture if you want it to.  I plan to leave mine up all of the time for ease of use rather than redoing the suction and placement each time.  It's easy to just take the arm and push it up really high when you're done, take the dryer out of it, and it's out of the way of anyone walking through, opening cabinets, etc until next time you want to use it.<br /><br />This is a pretty innovative product and I don't feel like I wasted money on it because it has made a loathsome part of my beauty routine easier...even if it did make my bathroom just slightly uglier :-)<br /><br />In all seriousness, if you have space or really hate trying to use a brush and properly dry your hair, this is worth it.  If I had more storage nearby, I'd probably take it down in between uses because it really is easy to suction and adjust once you understand what goes where and how it works.  I had fun trying this out and using it on my hair and plan to keep on using it in the future.  It's an odd device, for sure...but doesn't hesitate if you're worried it will be &#34;cheap&#34; or flimsy.  This thing could be a deadly weapon, it's so heavy and clearly intended to stay in place.  If that's what you need in a dryer holder, absolutely buy this.  I don't regret my purchase and I doubt you will, either.

I spritz some conditioner and water on the hair and that did not make any difference.<br /><br />Everyone knows this..<br />When you use conditioner and water on curly human hair it’s gets more curly but that wasn’t the case for this hair.. and I know this for sure because I have bought more than 5 curly human hair wigs on Amazon and all of them feat curly with water or conditioner.<br /><br />Now, this is definitely not the wig in the pictures.<br />Most of these sellers on amazon takes pictures from those professionals stylists on Instagram and use it to sell their products.<br /><br />The color is far from the one in the picture.<br /><br />In the video, that’s after the hair is being washed, and you can see I’m spraying water on it and nothings happen.. Doesn’t even change it form.

For one, it comes in a handy storage case which makes it hard to lose all the brushes and nail dotters.  Plus there is a see through vinyl flap that covers  them too.  It unrolls three times after you unsnap the buttons and spreads your array of brushes and dotting tools.  You end up with a total of 14 brushes that range from fan brushes to fine tipped brushes.  There are five double-ended dotters and no, they aren't all the same size.  I think a few are.  There is also a dotting pen with just one small dot which you could use for line work if the brushes are too hard for you.  The entire set is compact and portable.<br /><br />As for cleaning them....I've had no issue with mine.  I cleaned the polish of with nail polish remover, wiped that off, then washed it with dish soap and let dry.  One of my brushes  became a little stiff but all I did was run my finger across it a few times and smooshed it on  my table.

I didn’t take a pic of what it looks like because it’s that bad so you’ll just have to take my word for it. I’m not sure who would even like the matte top coat because it’s not pretty at all and the shiny top coat looks like nails are still wet and is so much prettier. Anyway, the polish does start to show some wear and tear (peeling & chipping) after a couple of days. To remove the polish, it says to soak off. I don’t remove mine that way, I just peel it off. I’m not sure if that’s healthy or not for my nails but it’s the easiest way for me. This is a decent set and I like that it includes a nail file too which I find very helpful.",False,1,1,0,2
AHUJ3RHDB2IF4NBCBH5XQMSJTRZA,B0143XDZU6,4.0,"I am picky about my mascara. It has to be waterproof, has to be lengthening and make it look like I have eye lashes. It can't cause irritation when I wear contacts. The reason I tried this product was because I was out of mascara and was being adventurous in trying a new product. This product was dark, made it look like I had lashes, and made them look longer. I don't remember seeing anything about being waterproof but I wore it my first day when it was hot and I didn't have black eyes by the end of the day! I don't see much &#34;thickening&#34; going on with this product though. My lashes are very thin and minimal due to wearing mascara for so many years. I feel this product helped in making them stand out, but not so much making them look thick and perhaps fake-ish. I began layering this on with my other go to mascara and it definitely helps. Not a bad product by any means, just not your product if your main purpose is thickening.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest opinion. No matter the price I paid for it, all statements are truly my own and are no way altered.

I keep reading reviews that say &#34;it won't brush through my extremely curly hair.&#34; Well of course it won't! It isn't a magical brush that will glide through hair. When using the heated brush, I used my regular brush with it because the ends wouldn't get straightened.

My hair didn't turn out to be &#34;bone straight&#34; but it's better than when I started. My ends didn't get straightened but I also just really need a hair cut so I am not blaming the product for that. But it is true what people are saying, it doesn't get hot enough.

The brushes are firmly attached to the wooden handle and I liked the compact carrier case it came with. It's a great beginner's set and will get the job done.<br /><br />Cons-The brushes themselves are cheaply made. The synthetic fibers of the brush leave your makeup streaky and leaves little black hairs all over your face. The brushes are also not full enough and don't pick up enough of the makeup you're using (Especially highlighter with the fan brushes)  and so you have to go over them again and again to get full color.<br /><br />Conclusion: A good brush set for beginners, but you'd be better off splurging on a better brush set than trying to save money with these junky brushes if you're a makeup guru.",False,1,1,0,2
AHLTACP2W4AY6YH5HGTX4KWS7F7A,B0052YFCSO,1.0,"This stuff could be used as a torture device in interrogations...after using it on my chest, stomach, shoulders, and groin, it feels as though I have been laying in the summer sun ALL day. Imagine bright red sunburn with bubbly skin, as though you've gotten sun poisoning. I spot tested it and everything seemed fine. I was so incredibly wrong. Rinsing in the shower really just made it burn even worse, even with seemingly FREEZING cold water. The &#34;Calm Balm&#34; was almost like squirting lemon juice into a fresh, open wound. Even a whole hour after using it, while having a fan blowing cold air on me from outside, it STILL feels like one of the worst sunburns I've ever experienced. Worst part is, I don't even have slightly sensitive skin... Only after using nearly half a tube of Neosporin did the pain begin to subside. However I now look like a giant, shiny, &#34;sexy&#34; red lobster. And I want to scream like a lobster does in a pot of boiling water. I now know their pain. I used the product exactly as directed...using the sticks, waiting ten minutes, and then using the exfoliating glove, which itself caused extreme discomfort while &#34;lightly buffing&#34; the skin (imagine taking 100 grit sandpaper to a sunburn). In fact I think the exfoliating glove is what started all of the pain. I figured &#34;Hell, I'm a manly man, BUFF THROUGH THE PAIN!!!&#34; But holy balls it was like trying to use a hairdryer to put out a forest fire.<br /><br />In closing, this product is AWFUL, and I want to jump into the nearest frozen lake I can find, in hopes of dying of hypothermia & drowning, because that would be less uncomfortable than these tubes of terrorist cream. To angry wives/girlfriends, this would be PERFECT if your man has been cheating on you and you seek revenge.

AETIE4V5ICEE772VHUXLUON6MO6A,B01N2OD862,5.0,"Best renewal exfoliator I have used to date and leaves skin lovely and soft. The product is just as described, I'm really satisfied with it. The exfoliant leaves the skin soft, smooth, clean and moisturized! Great for any skin tone. I Although, would say mine is particularly sensitive, I do have a reddish tone (blotchy almost) when using some products, and it does not flare up so I would imagine it's great if you do have this kind of sensitivity as well.<br /><br />~How to Use~<br />Apply to clean skin by using a cotton pad.<br />Rub onto the skin and let stand for 1-3 minutes. Rinse with warm water.<br />Use once or twice a week.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. No strong odors!<br />There is no nauseating perfume smell, just a gentle clean scent that doesn't overpower. It is a natural product rather than a mixture of chemicals.<br /><br />2. Perfect texture, not too sticky or slimy<br />The texture feels soft and natural, instead of chemically-enhanced. I like that I can adjust the amount of texture by simply rubbing my hands. Feels much more cleansing and safe for my skin than other cleansers I've tried that simply dispense a dollop of chemical foam.<br /><br />3. Perfect pH balance for cleansing and moisturization without dryness:<br />The solution cleans just the right amount. As someone with combination skin, I need something that can clean thoroughly to prevent acne breakouts. I was pleasantly surprised that this product did not leave my face with that dry, salicylic acid feeling AT ALL. I was very happy about this, as I've spent way too much money on products that leave my skin completely dehydrated. I suspect it is the pH balancing that makes this an ideal cleansing agent for the sensitive skin of the face.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.

This is a Korean-made product and I do tend to be a fan of most Korean skin care products.<br /><br />This arrives in a 6.76 ounce bottle. It was nicely sealed. I was modestly concerned about the product's clearly labeled manufacturing date 3/11/2020 indicating I'm receiving it over 16 months after the manufacturing date. While this isn't always an issue, it doesn't particularly instill confidence.<br /><br />This lotion uses what the manufacturer calls MLE Technology along with Defensamide and Ceramides along with Squalane for moisturizing. It is noted as being good for all ages including babies and children.<br /><br />While I had some concerns, I'm overall pleased with the product's performance. This is a white, smooth lotion that applies easily. I'd actually just had some seasonal allergy reactions on my skin while working in the yard and opted to use this on my skin. It soothed my skin greatly and has gone to work surprisingly rapidly to calm down my inflamed, swollen skin. I'm actually quite impressed.<br /><br />There's no scent that I can detect.<br /><br />In terms of value, this is fairly modest. While this is being advertised as somewhat of a premium lotion, I'm not sure I can justify continued use - we'll see how it continues to do and if I notice a definite improvement over other products. However, I definitely can't deny that it's effective and it is definitely making my skin look and feel better.<br /><br />Zeroid is noted as the #1 Dermacosmetic in Korea for the last decade. It's easy to understand why as this product works incredibly well and surprisingly quickly.<br /><br />Overall, while I am a bit concerned about the manufacturing date and the price point is a touch high I'll continue to use and compare it to other available products.

This is something I wouldn't expect from what is undeniably a more premium product. I set aside that concern and enthusiastically tried the product. It seems like when the mask settles in the canister that it takes a couple of pumps to get it to dispense, though once it does everything is fine. These are minor bugs, but if they want to tap into the premium market then presentation matters.<br /><br />It takes very little to apply and it smooths out evenly on the face and you let it activate over the next 5-10 minutes before rinsing it off. I could definitely feel it activate and I will definitely say my face felt vibrant and energized throughout my work day each time I've used it. I noticed on video meetings that I even looked more energized. So, that's pretty cool.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'm seeing anything resembling a long-term benefit with the mask. This feels like something I'd use on a day when I have an important meeting or am really dressed to impress. The way that it brightens the skin makes me look healthier and more alert. So, it's not a daily use kind of product for me but it's certainly something I can see turning to when my face needs that extra boost because it definitely gives it a rather remarkable boost that looks and feels wonderful.<br /><br />While packaging and presentation could use some tweaking, I'm still inclined to give this a thumbs up  and it's a product I'll continue to use and then I'll evaluate any future purchases once I see how my face looks and feels once this canister is gone.",False,1,1,1,3

The face wash includes 20% Vitamin C along with Organic Aloe Vera, MSM, and Organic Rose Hip Oil. It utilizes the actual lemon peel, a process that is noted to contain 5-10 times more vitamins than the lemon juice. The wash is designed to naturally exfoliate, remove blackheads, and naturally lighten the skin.<br /><br />While the 4-ounce bottle seems quite small, it takes very little to do the job. The wash comes out as a sort of milky lotion that lathers lightly yet effectively. The lemon peel contains citric and phytic acids and I felt that sort of acidic quality on my face, but it was lighter than a typical exfoliant. It left my skin cleaner, but in a healthy way rather than in a glowing way.<br /><br />This is designed to be a daily face wash. I'm not completely sure I'd use it on a daily basis given its price point, but I have to admit it feels so natural and has been so effective that I may be convinced otherwise by the time this first bottle is actually done. I love the way that it's making my face look and feel and I'm super pleased with the healthier appearance.<br /><br />For me, this has turned out to be rather gentle giant of a face wash.

I bought this product to try to deal with the sun damaged skin on the backs of my hands. Many brown spots (from too much sun exposure), wrinkles, dry skin, and crepe like skin. I did get some filler in my hands as they were starting to look like skeletons, and that made them look years younger, but the skin still needed a lot of help.

WOW! I was more than impressed. I started by using my Clarisonic on the backs of my hands with a gentle cleanser and patting them dry and applying a small drop of this moisturizer to each hand while it was still moist.The first result I noticed was around days 3-5 yhe dryness was just about disappearing, my skin was soft and smooth. Brown spots took a bit longer, about 2 weeks, to really start to fade, but that is probably because the skin on your hands is so different from your face, and these were some bad brown spots. The wrinkles were the last to respond. While I could see mild improvement at 2 weeks, it took 4 weeks to see significant results.

The whole process to bleach, dye and final wash took me almost 4 hours, two boxes of product, one towel and now a blue bathroom sink. My hair did not get fully “hay blonde” that Splat suggests and that’s after using 2 bottles of bleach. I used 2 dark blue dye bottles and only one of the teal.<br />I waited over 48 hours before I did the first real wash and then have washed my hair every third day to try to preserve the color as long as possible and I can literally see it fading hard every shower and that’s using color safe products. I’m at the 2 week mark and my hair is now green and patchy with bleached hair showing through. I followed the box directions precisely and did everything I was supposed to. I even contacted Splat to get further tips and tricks on making it last and still it sucks. I understand this is an at home kit and I wasn’t really expecting too much from it considering all the reviews I read before hand but I expected more than this. Even the glove are too short in my opinion. They barely go to the beginning of my wrist which meant the dye was able to find its way under the gloves. This dye does truly dye anything it touches so cover literally everything before hand to prevent accidents. I was able to remove it from my skin using some baby oil and a towel so that’s easy but my sink is now blue.<br />There are further instructions that they should have stated on the box so beginners can get the most out of the box.

I read everything I could and watched every video I could find so I’m not judging this product on that factor.

I had to physically stir it up before I could even use it.<br /><br />The smell was overpowering. It wasn’t necessarily bad, just was too strong. I also thought the scrub was way too rough.

I like that you can use the bar only where extra conditioning is needed, like on the ends of the hair, and skip the scalp. It didn’t seem to be as moisturizing as some traditional liquid conditioners I’ve used, but it gets the job done and doesn’t leave a grimy feel on the hair.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this product is that the first two ingredients are alcohol.

AFDZDRDI4WGRBIKJ3AFAFMTVM4GQ,B01185LNOW,5.0,"I love apricot kernel oil. It definitely one of my favorite carrier oils because it has so many uses. It's nice to have a 16 ounce bottle of cold pressed oil to work with. Here are just a few of the uses for this wonderful oil:<br /><br />1) Apricot kernel oil for Skin<br />Apricot kernel oil is good for people with sensitive skin. It is non-irritant and soothing for the skin. It is light and quickly makes the skin soft and smooth. Apricot oil penetrates deep into the skin. It is easy to apply on the skin as it quickly spreads on the skin. It soothes irritated skin. A massage with apricot kernel oil is good for dry, parched skin. It can be used post shower to lock the moisture into the skin. Since it is light, it wont leave a greasy residue. Once absorbed into skin, it provides moisturization for hours. Apricot kernel oil is one of the best carrier oils for massage as it penetrates nicely into the skin and also improves the delivery of essential oils and other herbal agents. This oil is also good for infusing with herbs and absorbing their essence. It can be utilized for various kinds of massage that require an oil.<br />2. Apricot kernel oil for Hair<br />Apricot oil is loved by many people around the world for their hair care. When applied to the hair shafts,it helps to detangle hair. These are the health benefits that organic apricot oil provides to hair. It promotes hair growth because of the nutrients in it, especially Vitamin E. It reduces dry scalp problems and helps to achieve gorgeous shiny hair without any greasiness. When used as a hot oil treatment, it conditions the hair and provides them nutrition. It softens the hair, so that they are more manageable and easily combed.<br />3. As an Under Eye Cream<br />Apricot oil can be applied just like almond oil for healing under eye skin. It aids in reducing dark circles, puffiness and helps to strengthen the skin around this region. With regular application of apricot kernel oil, one can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes.<br />4. Face Oil<br />Apricot kernel oil is a nice face oil, especially when compared to other heavier oils. It helps to improve skin tone, nourish the skin and lower the appearance of aging signs, like wrinkles, lines and blemishes. However, this oil should be avoided by people who are suffering from acne or are prone to acne. That is because it has a comedogenicity of 2. This means that the oil is mildly comedogenic and it can clog skin pores. This may result in acne breakouts and blackheads.<br />5. Heart Health<br />Consumption of apricot kernel oil can be a healthy choice for the heart and the cardiovascular system. This oil has demonstrated the ability to lower the risk of heart attack in rats and can possibly perform the same function in humans. You can use apricot oil as a salad dressing and by using it for cooking certain recipes that go well with the flavor of this oil.<br /><br />I received my oils at a discount for my unbiased review.

Because I am getting older and we lose that wonderful thick lash look we have we are younger i thought it would be great to use to condition my lashes and keep them healthier and maybe keep from losing some. I didn't expect it to be white but it does make it easier to see when you apply it. I found it easier to apply by brushing across my lashing instead of brushing base to tip. I even used the very end of the brush so swipe across hard to get areas. I curled my lashes as usual, then applied the primer. I tried mascara immediately and also tried waiting for the primer to dry. It worked best for me after it dried. When I applied while the primer was wet it made my curled lashes droop and I couldn't tell I had curled them. But when I waited just a few minutes, because it does dry quickly, then applied I was very happy with the results. I would never apply , then curl for fear of pulling out lashes that might stick to the curler. I also use the product to condition my lashes while I sleep. I put on before going to bed each night.

I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it's misleading to claim there are only natural ingredients in here.  Lauryl glucoside, decyl glucoside, and sodium cocoyl glutamate aren't truly 100% natural ingredients, although they are gentle and safe, and personally I would actually prefer a face wash with cleansing agents like this included rather than not. Some people might be might be sensitive to the essential oils in here but the majority of people most likely aren't, and again personally I'd SO much rather see things like chamomile extract, lavendar oil, and tea tree oil than a long list of chemicals!!!  I'm super happy I found this for my son Peter and would most definitely order it again at the full price if it continues to work well for him.

The description sounds so appealing, gentle and pure, but there are several things that really bother me. First of all, this is definitely NOT a natural product. There are tons of ingredients in here that don't pass that test at all (read the label!).  Secondly, the two sunscreens that are listed as active ingredients don't protect against UVA rays, only UVB. Titanium dioxide which protects against UVA rays also is in here but not labeled as an active ingredient, and it doesn't give a percentage. Thirdly, if you research ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate you will see that it is not considered to be an entirely safe ingredient. With all that said, I do like the texture. It is light yet moisturizing, and it feels smooth and even a little silky because of the cyclopentasiloxane (synthetic silicone) in it.  I think the description of this is misleading though, and although I don't hate it, it wouldn't be my first choice for a pure, natural, and entirely safe sunscreen.

It has a lovely soft scent which is great if fragrant washes aren’t your thing. I did enjoy the scent. However honestly for me that’s where it stopped. There are I believe strawberry seeds in the mix in place of larger salts or gritty stuff. When I exfoliate I expect it to feel li my skin gets an extra scrub (not too much either) and this felt more like a wash with an occasional soft seed rolling across my face.

I like Majestic products I have used. They do not test on animals and use safe and natural ingredients. I took a picture of the label so you can see what is used in this sunscreen including grape seed oil, organic sunflower oil, organic beeswax and more. It is important to do that, not just to confirm it's natural, but also to confirm that you or your baby or child has no allergies to the ingredients.<br /><br />Please see my pictures for all of the product information - Drug Facts, Uses, Warnings, Directions and Ingredients.<br /><br />The SPF is 30 and says on the label that it regains SPF after 40 minutes in the water.

AGMX4B64FLJBCO6N63XTBAXFDUPQ,B01CUSBH3I,5.0,"I am a huge advocate of anti-aging products. I also love getting gel nail polish for hands and regular polish that matches on my feet. I do this at home with a UV light I bought on Amazon.com that can fit two hands or feet at a time. (I saved a lot of money doing gel at home and learned to do this by observation at a nail shop and also with Youtube, my favorite place for things like this, crafts, cooking tutorials, etc.)<br /><br />It struck me that I am exposing my hands to UV rays with the UV light. This is going to add freckles and age spots sometime later in life due to the UV exposure. Your hands, neck, face, and décolletage areas are the places that show age the most. Check out matured women if you don't believe me.<br /><br />I put sunscreen on those areas, even the back of my hands, but I tend to wash my hands for random things when doing things around the house = need to reapply. I thought that there has to be something out there for hand protection with UV lights since nail shops are so popular. I use Amazon a lot to avoid stores (Amazon usually has the best price anyhow) and found the OC Nails UV Shield Glove. I chose classic white.<br /><br />I love them! They fit great. I think it's one size fit all. I have long, tapering fingers and was concerned how far up it would cover each digit. It turned out to be a non-issue. I am posting a few pictures. I have a ring with a raised stone one one finger that is sitting there comfortably under the glove. I also need to re-do my gel polish. Just keeping it real here. It's that kind of week.

AGMX4B64FLJBCO6N63XTBAXFDUPQ,B0114DPMYA,5.0,"I am very pleased so far with the InterSight Naturals Hyaluronic Acid so far. It comes in a 1 oz bottle but a little goes a long way. I will explain in my review.<br /><br />There are a lot of benefits in general to your body with Hyaluronic Acid, including your skin and face. The major benefit is that it is an anti-aging agent. We already have this in our skin. As we age, we lose some along with collagen. Hyaluronic Acid in this Serum allows your skin to retain more moisture, whether you have oily skin or not. It has a lightweight texture and works for oily or dry skin and sensitive skin too. That's great because I personally have all of that going on with my face.<br /><br />There are other serums out there similar to this. I like InterSight's Hyaluronic Acid because it is free of fragrance/scent and drying agents like alcohol. It's ingredients include (of course) hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, green tea, jojoba oil, vitamins c and e and aloe. So, if you are familiar with any of these you will know that these are elements are soothing to the skin and each have their own benefits. I like products that have natural ingredients versus a lot of chemicals that I don't know how to pronounce.<br /><br />This product is advertised to activate collagen production, which is what the h. acid does. It goes beneath the skin's surface when applied correctly and retains moisture, plumping it up like youthful skin. When I use this, I notice that my skin appearance is very youthful and fresh. You can use your own moisturizer afterwards (I switch it up personally but mainly use Vanicream Light Lotion, not cream, because it's &#34;Dye free, perfume/fragrance free, lanolin free, paraben free, formaldehyde free.&#34; Also, it isn't greasy.)<br /><br />This bottle comes with a dropper in it. I have a few tips if it will help anyone for use.<br /><br />1. The product directions are teeny tiny but it says to wash and dry your face, neck and décolletage area first.<br />2. Apply the product. I found that it's easier and less waste to put three drops on my left 3 finger pads - ring, middle and pointer finger, share some with the same fingers on the right hand and apply with an upward direction starting with the décolletage and neck area.<br />*Note - a little goes a long way. I used less than half a dropperful for 1 treatment.<br />*The drops I put on my left finger pads initially are maybe the circumference of or slightly less than a notebook paper hole that is punched out.<br />*Don't put any in your eye socket including eyebrows.<br />*Get close to your hairline but not in it, especially if you color your hair or are hiding gray hairs. Washing your hairline and putting products like this on it will fade the color quicker, at least when you are trying to cover up random stray gray or white hairs.<br />3. Let the product dry before adding moisturizer and then makeup (if any). It doesn't take too long. If you are really in a rush, I have a tip. I keep the mini, battery operated personal fans around for facial stuff. It will help it dry faster.<br />4. Personal tip - Use a moisturizer with SPF 30 or greater during the day when using this (and when not using it too!) I use Elta MD UV Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 45, the transparent version for a lot of reasons. Product is great, non-greasy, soaks in, is for the face and body, cost is reasonable, no scent and it protects my skin! I want to share this because I love products but have some I stick because of how affective it is.<br /><br />This product is not sticky, greasy, and leaves zero residue on your hands, but I recommend washing them anyhow afterwards. Who knows if you may rub your eye, etc.<br /><br />One last tip in case you don't know why you should use it on your décolletage, neck in addition to the face. Guess where aging shows the most? The neck and, not listed prior, your hands! Neck wise-look at people and their necks. The age usually shows up sooner. So, it's important to include it. I include those areas when getting facial peels too - glycolic or salicylic acid - in the fall and winter only. When you put sunscreen on, consider putting it on your hands too, or for that matter, your arms, especially the side that faces the window when you ride in a car.<br /><br />I hope this helps. I have tried different hyaluronic products and really like this one for previous reasons - no scent, a little goes a long way, natural ingredients, leaves  my skin very smooth and doesn't irritate at all plus all the benefits of it.<br /><br />I did receive a discount for this product, but am not obligated in any way to give it a good review. This is totally my opinion based on my using the product as well as my experience with other products. I am very happy with it and plan on buying another retail on Amazon when this one runs out, whenever that is!

It’s much easier to glue a nail back on than to deal with dried glue all over your cuticles and between your nail and finger skin. Also rubbing alcohol takes the excess glue off if you do have issues.<br /><br />Also! Big tip - start with your pinky nails first.

These are so plush and soft, but also very absorbent. I love the bright colors. My absolute favorite thing about them is that they are large enough to fit all my hair. My hair isn't terribly long--three inches or so past my shoulders, and it's of medium thickness, I would say. Generally, my hair is too long for the typical hair wrap and an inch or so peaks out at the end of the twist. Not with these! These hold all my hair and there is maybe an extra inch of material, so they can hold even longer hair! And because they are so much bigger than the typical ones I use, they don't pull my hair so tight, which can result in a weird kink in the hair around my face, especially my bangs.<br /><br />These don't completely dry your hair, but they do suck up a lot of the water.

This set includes one detailing brush, one dotting pen, one curving paint brush, one drawing brush, two gel nail brushes, two fan brushes (which I love the best), three liner brushes of different sizes and five double head acrylic dotting pens also different sizes. Now, each and everyone are perfectly placed in a magnetic snapped bag you can fold up and snap together. There are perfectly little spots for each individual tool to keep them in perfect shape. I couldn't be happier, nor could my nieces. They LOVE this twenty piece pink nail art painting kit. I purchased this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.

While the ingredients are natural - I am not feeling much of a change in my skin.  I do think it helped a little. But my skin was already nice to begin with (I struggle more with sagging then lines anyway).  Still? Considering how natural, easy to apply and how great it smells - it deserves 3 stars.<br /><br />Update:<br />2 weeks into using and while I still like this serum, I haven't noticed that much of a diffrence in my skin. Maybe it needs more time.  I will keep it at 4 stars because it does not irritate my skin, smells lovely and it is reasonably priced. I am almost done with the bottle - ha, maybe one week left if that - but to be fair I put it on 2X a day, in the AM and at night before bed.  I will be ordering another cream and review and compare.<br /><br />I've only had this serum for about a week but I already feel like it's making my skin glow a bit more.  I took some pictures today and this is with the serum on, including around my eyes as well as with my daily cream mixed with a very small amount of neutral foundation.  I have not noticed any irritation around my eyes when putting it on or anywhere else on my face - not sure why some reviewers say this makes them break out - I have not had that expereince.<br /><br />I do notice that I need to put moisturizer on after I put this serum on otherwise, my face feels stiff and constricted. I wait for five minutes and then apply my moisture/light foundation.  The serum has very little smell and the color is like vanilla and yes it is creamy and supposed to be.  I'm leaving it at four stars until I review it again after another week. The company says, if after two weeks you do not like the affect you can return it.  I'm also leaving it at four stars because I wish it was bigger - the size of the bottle is small, see pics.<br /><br />Overall though?

The wipes themselves are smaller than the other makeup remover wipes that we have used from other brands so you may need to use 2 or 3 of these depending on how much makeup you are wearing. Since there are only 44 in a package and considering they are smaller, you will go through these faster than other brands. They do an okay job or removing the makeup and it may take some scrubbing for some makeup to come fully off. The smell is okay and lightly scented, I wish they were unscented to be honest. After I used them I felt like there was a slight film left on my face and my face wasn't really clean. My daughter didn't have that experience but after using them a few times, her skin started to break out with some acne. So that could have been a reaction to the wipes or just her teenage skin.

I have always been a fan of Maybelline's Colossal mascara, but they decided to change up the formula a while back and it's just not the same, especially the waterproof one.<br /><br />Decided to give this one a shot and here is what I have found so far:<br /><br />1. It's definitely not waterproof, so if you have any kind of allergies and watery eyes, beware, it will smudge all over the place.<br />2. It applies nicely. Gives even coverage on the lashes without weighing them down with too much product. I would say it is mostly true to the name of length and lift as it does do both, just don't be expecting to look like you have false lashes on.<br />3. The wand brush is a little more streamlined compared to that of the Colossal, which I think helps with the lifting and lengthening. Depending on how you like your lashes to look, a coat or two with this and you're good to go.<br />4. Durability - here is where I had somewhat of an issue. I apply my makeup in the morning before work (even with working from home I never know when I will have an impromptu video call, so I'm always prepared). This usually occurs shortly before 7am and I need my makeup to last me ALL DAY because I usually don't get around to washing it off until 10-11pm. What I have found with the Almay is that even though it goes on nice and evenly, half way through my day I start to find my lashes feeling weighed down and notice they start clumping together. I thought it was odd, so decided to try again the next day to see what happened and sure enough, same thing. I don't know if it's just due to the formula or what but that has been my experience.<br />5. Washes off very easily. I use coconut oil to remove my makeup and then use my cleanser to completely wash my face and I haven't had any issues with removal.<br /><br />Since I do actually like the product aside from it's durability, I've decided to play around with it and see if I can get it to wear a little better. What I've been experimenting with is applying this first to add length and then apply my waterproof mascara to sort of set them both (and so it gives me the waterproof protection I need) and it seems to be holding up when used this way.

It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ingredients for the very sensitive of skins. Ingredients like Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene can be an allergen. It may have prebiotics which is good but one good ingredient does not negate a potentially irritating one. I'm all for someone coming up with a safe and good cologne for baby but I'm not entirely sold on this product just yet. I did read up on some additional information but I need more convincing for me to be on board with this perfume for infants. I do love the story of why the founder wanted to create these scents for little ones but I'm just not fully on board with some of the ingredients used.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will be using this on my baby but I think a more appropriate age is pre-teen or teens. I may have been a little more open to a ""cleaner"" perfume for that age range as I'm sure there's a market for that. From what I read, the founder is going to be launching perfumes for that age group, so that might be more appropriate.<br /><br />My baby actually smells nice from good hygiene so he doesn't need anything else but I understand the concept behind these scents. Fragrances do invoke certain memories, just like music. There are certain scents that I get a whiff of and it immediately transports me back to that day, the person, or the memories of that particular time period.

They aren't allowed to go to a real nail salon/spa yet so I planned an at home ""spa day"" for them, with their mom's approval of course. The foot spa uses batteries so I was able to do this anywhere and not have to worry about being close to an outlet.

You obviously aren't going to see overnight results but if you keep at it you will notice a difference on your wrinkles. Luckily I don't have too many yet but I did use it on the little areas where I'm starting to see wrinkles. I noticed a tightening of the areas I used the laser on for the past 3 months. I really liked the hyaluronic acid serum that was included in the set - the serum felt gentle and has no smell (fragrance free). On some days where I didn't use the laser I would still use the serum to moisturize my face. I looked into purchasing just the serum, which they do have for sale, as I really like the product. The laser is easy to operate and charge (usb). I didn't use this daily as I wanted to give my skin a rest, but I think if you used this religiously then you would see results at a much faster rate. It isn't painful, but you feel a little zap. I would equate it to the same level of ""pain"" as a derma roller, that spikey/zappy feeling - not painful, not super uncomfortable.

I can also smell the tea tree, so I would say it is a good combination of both. I do like the ingredients and don't see a lot of unnecessary ""stuff"", which is a huge plus! I know some people are saying this is pricey for hand soap but you also have to look at the ingredients they use, and in this case, seems to be of quality.

I like that it comes in a glass jar (better than plastic), although I also have to say that balm in a jar isn't my favorite. I have nails so whenever I am trying to apply, it gets lodged in between my nails - gross! That said, it isn't a big deal as long as it is good lip balm.

First of all, brand aside, this shampoo smells lovely. It is the scent of white tea, ginger, and citrus. This shampoo is free of parabens, artifical colors and SLS - which is always appreciated. I used this to wash my hair and after using this I didn't feel like my hair was dry and stripped of all oils like some ""for hotel"" type of products tend to do. This quality and the brand name is definitely more of a product I would see in a nice boutique hotel or a higher end hotel. If I had an airbnb I would stock it with a product like this one. All that aside, this makes a good shampoo for weekend getaways and short term travel. Each bottle is 50mL / 1.7 fl oz, which for me personally would be last about 4-6 uses. That of course, depends on the length of your hair and how many people you are sharing this bottle of mini shampoo with. This pack has 30 bottles, and at the current price of under $20, it comes to about 65 cents per bottle. The bottle is pretty sturdy with a nice chrome screw cap so I plan to save these mini bottles and reuse/refill with my own shampoo afterwards. I like to repurpose and keep these plastics out from the landfill or at least use them until they're worn down/grimy. I have Badgley Mischka clothes and shoes so it is nice to see they've expanded to hotel toiletries. I really like the smell of this and cannot stop smelling it. As I'm typing this, I can also smell this in my hair.

I still really like the Sibu brand and their sea buckthorn oil. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they now have skincare products. My favorite product in this set is still the sea buckthorn supplements (60 softgels). I am still nursing so I won't be taking this just yet but I am just about done nursing. The supplement is one thing I am looking forward to taking again. The expiration date is listed on the bottom of the bottle. I do like the smell of the anytime face wash, and it  did a nice job of cleaning my face without drying it out. I do get little hormonal breakouts here and there so this is a good face wash for me. I've also tried the daily facial defense oil, a zit zapper, but it is too soon to tell if it works. It does a great job of moisturizing my face for sure as it is packed with different kinds of oils (argan, sea buckthorn, lavender, patchouli, etc). All these products are made in the USA, which I know is important for some people. This is a good set of skincare basics for acne prone skin.

Is the name of this product line ""NOT OR"" or ""Not for him or her"" or ""NxO"" or ""NO""? It is just all very confusing.

I could slightly feel it on my skin after applying but it wasn't greasy or uncomfortable. The exfoliator has little shea nut powder beads in it to help exfoliate and scrub, and has a thick consistency.

It isn't a super strong, gritty scrub but more on the gentler side.

I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don’t want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don’t want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn’t feel good about the stuff in it.

In its curly state it's a pain to care for but the traditional blow dry and flat iron method is both tedious and damaging to my hair.<br /><br />When wet to straight irons came out, I immediately hopped on board because it just made more sense that heating my hair while wet would be less damaging to it. Through this I got hooked lol. But even with that it is a bit tedious.... though it did help me figure out that I could flat iron my hair dry and skip the blow dryer.<br /><br />My boyfriend has one of these brushes and I tried it as a quick way to straighten my hair in the am. I was SUPER impressed! But it had some design flaws that made me seek my own, and landed me here.<br /><br />From what I've seen comparing this brush to the more popular Rinfy and his brush, they've reallly improved upon the original design concepts. Most notably, the buttons are on the front of the handle and not the sides, down near the cord instead of anywhere up near the head.  This along with the way they're shaped to be concaved makes it highly unlikely they'll be pressed by accident. But even if you do press them by accident, the device automatically locks them about 30s after the temperature is set. If you want to change the temp or turn it off after that, you need to click the power button twice to unlock them.<br /><br />The teeth are not only steep enough to accommodate my thick hair, but there's also way more of them packed more densely together. This seems to make this brush MUCH quicker at straightening my hair, and it can also get it board straight. The other brushes have only gotten it as close as a little wave.<br /><br />Since my hair is so thick, I also have to place my hand on the bristles while I pull the brush through so it gets all my hair in it. This is the only model I've tried which hasn't burned me even once while using it so far. The teeth are so densely packed that there is no way for a finger or the side of my hand to slip down past the safety portion of it.<br /><br />Quick heating? Honestly I don't know why anyone tries to claim that.... I've never seen any heated hair product heat up quickly. My stove doesn't even heat up quickly. I hardly expect my straightening iron or brush to defy the laws of physics so I don't have to wait a few minutes for it to heat up. That's why I turn it on BEFORE I'm ready to use it. 😉<br /><br />All joking aside though, this really is a fantastic brush. It even FEELS high quality. Nice weight, premium plastics, slick design.

I washed my hair and upon trying to be detangler comb I found it was completely useless so I used my own full sized comb and sectioned a portion of the top of my hair and rolled it in one of the smaller rollers.

AEASUJ4J4WEVE3TVQ342L5JRRKMQ,B07THX27HJ,3.0,"This was my first time using hair chalk. After reading the reviews I was hopeful for good results with little mess.  Well, the results were just under satisfying and the mess was exactly what I was worried about.<br />It’s chalk, I get it. But there were so many reviews saying the color stayed in and didn’t rub off onto white clothing! Thank goodness my daughter’s costume was black.  Though we could still see blue/green on her shoulders and back. Her neck was blue/green for 3 days. And after 3 showers her hair still had color in it.<br />We used leave in conditioner and hairspray since I read many reviews advocating for them.  I think if your hair is short, this could benefit you. My daughters hair is long and thick, and it was awful. I tried not to brush, but I inevitably had to comb horrible knots caused by the chalk being rubbed onto damp hair. (And a spray bottle is a must, chalk on dry hair is a joke.) This caused much of the color to fly away in clouds of chalk.<br />True, her hair was colored blue/green, but it was not the vibrant color that initially came off of the chalk. It was muted at best.<br /><br />I strongly recommend doing this outside and with clothing on you don’t care about. Any tools you use in the process will subsequently get chalk all over it. Our flat and curling irons cleaned up easy enough.<br />I got some wet chalk on my light blue jeans and the color has stained.<br />When you iron your hair the chalk will dissipate in colorful clouds. And the remaining color will slowly work itself out on your clothes, chairs, couches, pillows, and eventually multiple showers.<br />I will say I chose chalk over dye for the benefit of no chemicals on my girl or in my house.

AGUYM7SOL35NHG5J3RC436V6XZRQ,B007VXJK6E,5.0,"I had been thinking about getting a new brush for a while. I have had an Oral-B Sonicare for about 4 years. It still works, but I had been thinking there may be something better with the advance of technology the last few years. The Sonicare brush vibrated from side to side, which I have always like much better than the brushes that rotate in a circle so I was very nervous about giving this brush a shot. All I can say is, WOW!<br /><br />This brush is amazing. The Sonicare never seem to brush hard enough, whereas the top setting on this brush is exactly what I hoped it would be. I was also always a bit confused how firm I should hold the brush against my teeth and the 4000 series essentially makes that dummy proof as a giant red light comes on when you are pressing to firm.<br /><br />The best comparison I can make is to describe this as the cordless version of the brush your dentist uses. It's that swirling brush that leaves your teeth feeling like you just left Dr. Dental's office each day. For folks that don't like as firm or rough a brush, there's enough settings to tone it down, but I have found that most brushes don't have a setting firm enough rather than delicate enough. This brush solves that problem.<br /><br />I read some complaints about the handle, the charger, etc. I can't imagine why people could even complain as it's the last thing I would notice nor do I think either are a problem. The charging stand is nice and you can remove the holding case that attaches to it if you're worried about counter space. You also get a nice travel case, which is a huge plus because every time I took my sonicare on vacation, I would have to bring it with my carry on or else the on button would also get pushed in the suitcase and end up basically dead by the time I arrive.<br /><br />I had a tough time justifying buying a new brush when I had one that worked fine.

I did her hair in sections because the back is very curly but it helped tone down the frizz in her hair as well as keep the curls under control. To use it all you do is section the hair and literally just brush through it with the product on, I did go underneath the hair as well at the bottom of the hair just to get out a lot of the curl that is close to her scalp.<br />The product doesn't get so hot that you can't use it but it does go up to 230 degrees which is a good temperature to use and is definitely hot enough to straighten your hair but not burn your hand. On the side is a digital display to tell you what the temperature is set at and is very easy to read.<br />The best part of this product though for me was honestly the ease in which it can be used and how much time it actually saved me rather than actually straightening her hair with a flat iron. I also loved that it didn't get as hot as my flat iron as my daughter moves too much and is always claiming she's getting burnt because the flat iron does produce heat when it's closed to your scalp (of course she really isn't but she's 7 so try explaining the difference, it's impossible).

Instead of one long strip I have about 5 pieces of each lash to individually put on.<br />I found them easier to put on this way and I didn't have to shorten them to fit my eye, just space them out properly so I'm not just cutting up a good product unnecessarily that I paid full price for.<br /><br />3. Decide if you like the applicator took they gave you or not. I put the lashes on with my fingers, but then use the applicator took to really squeeze them into my normal eyelashes so they blend flawlessly and you can't see an awkward gap between real and fake.<br /><br />4. DO NOT TRY TO JUST RIP THEM OFF!!! You're going to rip your real eyelashes off.

My experience with full-size bottles is that you never know what you're getting in terms of quality. Unfortunately, I should have applied the same logic to these bottles. Lesson learned.<br /><br />These are really small. These are well-suited for misting hair, or misting plants, or spraying a solution into the air. That said, they also serve the purpose for which I needed such a bottle. There's no setting on these, and no way to turn them ""off"", if that is important to you.<br /><br />The bottle is sturdy plastic. The screw-cap is sturdy and secures tightly with no leaks, allowing me to shake my solution before use. At first use, this worked great for the first three days. Sprays were consistent and never missed a beat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at some point on the third day, the top of the trigger popped up and out of place, and the whole trigger assembly came apart. I am fairly mechanically inclined, and figured out, after some effort, how to put the whole thing back together. However, the same fault kept occurring. It seems the whole assembly is merely held together by very light connections, where things click together. If the top of the trigger pops out of place, the whole thing comes apart.<br /><br />My solution to this was to wrap an elastic hair-tie around the top of the trigger to the base of the trigger, just behind the actual trigger. This keeps the top from popping off and solves the problem. However, nobody should have to do that.<br /><br />I am still able to use the one bottle in this fashion, and I really can't complain.

AHA2ZOYANRKJNZQ6ZMK46U6TLKYQ,B07WVVHJ1K,3.0,"After having had a 1/4-inch buzzcut for about 15 years, about 18 months ago, I started growing out my hair, which is now quite long and sits around the bottom of my ear. As a result, I've been using different types of hair products to style it in different ways and keep it under control. Given a chance to try this pomade, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Packaging-wise, this is really simple: a glass jar with a metal lid. It has that old-timey barbershop feel, and would look nice on your counter or shelf, if you're into displaying your grooming products. Just remember it's glass, and an accidental drop on your counter or tiled floor is going to result in a disaster. The lid is a good quality and the seal seems to keep the product fresh.<br /><br />As soon as you open this jar, you'll recognize that ""barbershop scent"". It has that minty-eucalyptus odor that's refreshing and eye-opening. There are days when I use this, when I'm sitting at my desk I wonder ""what smells so good""...and I realize it's my hair. So if you're into good scents and smelling-good for yourself or others, you'll definitely like this.<br /><br />The consistency of this product is quite interesting. It looks like vanilla pudding. However, it's definitely much thicker than vanilla pudding. It's not sticky. It feels and looks like a compound that would end up very oily in your hair, but that's not the result. Even given my hair's length, I don't have to use a lot of this, and typically on damp hair I only have to use about two fingertips' worth of this product in my hair.<br /><br />While your mileage may vary, when I put this in my hair, it has an immediate effect. It provides immediate styling strength. It also helps to add a bit of volume, so that as I comb it through, I can easily prop-up the parts of my hair to give it a little volume and height. It dries well and doesn't get too stiff, leaving my hair with some movement, where I'm not afraid to run my fingers through it or adjust it. I'd say it's really good for my more ""casual day"" styles.<br /><br />My only complaint, and for me this is really important, is that it doesn't rinse well in the shower. I only wash my hair every third day to maintain its health, and while nearly every other product I use rinses almost cleanly without leaving much of a residue, this particular product won't rinse cleanly. This becomes a problem if I use this on day two, but want to use a different product on day 3, for example. It definitely adds to residual build-up. I realize not every product rinses cleanly with just water, but this one is particularly problematic, forcing me to either wash my hair earlier or plan the days on which I use this so the build-up doesn't become an issue on consecutive days. So, if like me, you don't like washing your hair often, this may be a deal-breaker.<br /><br />Overall, though, I'm quite impressed. The small jar is actually going to last me quite some time. It has a great scent and styling power. I'd probably use it every day if it weren't for the rinsing issue.",False,1,1,1,3

I wish the whole world could smell this good, I simply cannot explain the richness of these florals that were beyond what my imagination produced prior to taking a bath with this.<br /><br />Plumeria smells of jasmine, citrus, spices, gardenia, soft musk and pale moonlight lit beaches at night. If I could make a perfume it would definitely have this as the main note. Freesia native to southern Africa is soft, floral and romantic, and this pairing is for a truly luxe bath.

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,B09WN3KBDF,3.0,This eye massage thing doesn’t come with any directions. Now it’s not rocket science but I would like to know if there’s supposed to be heat in each function - if it supposed to pulse on the blue and the red light etc. I say this because I think there’s only heat when the red light is on. The rest seem to have no heat.  And it is very light - very slight heat as it is. It makes me question is there even heat or has my face heated the crystal up. So I was really expecting it to have much more heat. Also with both the red and the blue light it’s not a constant vibration - it’s kind of like a pulse vibration it goes on and it goes off then it goes on and it goes off.<br /><br />I do like that you can use it without the red or the blue light because the third setting is just a vibration - and that one is a constant vibration. But again that setting seems to have no heat at all.<br /><br />The crystal does seem to be some kind of quartz. It is a clear type of crystal so I assume it’s quartz because quartz is pretty common.<br /><br />It feels pretty nice around my eyes and if you hold it a certain way the red and/or or blue light will not get into your eye - you won’t see it while you use it.

If you wear it alone it is sort of dry on the lips – but not as dry as some others out there.  I like to add a slight layer of a balm first – just to give me some hydration.  It still comes off very matte that way but maybe doesn’t wear as well for longevity.  Even then – it didn’t come off on my teeth – just slightly on a cup I was drinking out of.

I will try instead to glue it back in.  Makes me wonder how long it will take for the other stones to also fall out…  Usually with jewelry, it is preferable to have prong set stones but apparently not in a headband as all those prongs grab and catch like every hair available on your head.  It pulled so much of my hair out when I tried simply removing it from my head.  (My pictures of the hair caught was AFTER I pulled most of the hair off the prongs.  It was easily 4 to 6 times as much stuck on it originally.)<br /><br />Because of the issue stated above I can only recommend for like one time use – knowing you are going to lose a bunch of hair because of it.

The velour makes sure it stays put and grips your hair and doesn't move.  The buttons are very pretty, stylish, and very much color coordinated with some of the headbands.  The only thing - because the buttons are 'so nice' and sort of concave - once you stick your mask on the button sort of sticks out a bit - more so than a flat button.  BUT with that being said - it grips your mask securely.  Some flat buttons let the mask slip off sort of easily.

If you have a problem with slicker material ones slipping out of your hair - THESE will stay put due to the velour grip on your head.  They are not too tight either - some bands I tried squish your brain...  The buttons are also the NICEST buttons I have seen on a mask headband like ever.  The ONLY flaw with the pretty and matching buttons that are sort of concave are that because of their pretty design once you put your mask strap on them they sort of lift up and away from the band itself (because of their concaveness) - so sort of stick out a bit.  So the pretty buttons can be a flaw.  But they work just fine - and it is probably me being anal.<br /><br />The buttons are also at a decent placement.  I wish they were the slightest bit lower, though - as that works best for me.  As they are now they are still good - any higher and they would be pulling your nose up by your mask.

AFYG4PB7CRUCPLPAZVKGOECY66WA,B01LYGMSMN,2.0,"I wanted to like this eyeliner pen, I really did...but I just couldn't. If you can get it for super cheap or almost free, it might be worth your time, but only if you don't have watery eyes AT ALL.<br /><br />I have several issues with this eyeliner:<br /><br />1. It isn't labeled as waterproof so I wasn't expecting it to be such, but I was expecting ""water resistant"". I mean, eyes are WET, and this product is meant to draw an artistic line on the eye area. Nope, it melted right off the second my eye got the slightest amount of dampness in the corner. Wing disappeared almost completely within 5 minutes of application on one eye.<br /><br />2. The color dries a bit more muted than the actual color appears to look upon first inspection. The plastic housing the felt eyeliner is a very vivid and bright blue, so I expected the product to be similar in color. As I drew it on my eyelid, it appeared very bright...but sadly dried down to a deeper and less bold shade of blue. I didn't want one shade lighter than ""navy"", I wanted a color that would truly stand out.<br /><br />3. If you miss a spot and have to go over an area that already has eyeliner, expect to have to redo the entire eye. Touching up a small area removes all of the color from the surrounding areas where the brush even gently grazes. Get it right the first time or redo the entire eye, there is NO layering with this brush eyeliner. Most of my liquid eyeliners are a bit more forgiving in this area.<br /><br />So bottom line...not what I hoped for. I expected more from a major brand like Too Faced. I guess there is a reason why it has been discontinued and is almost being given away with such a cheap price. The idea is nice...it looks like a writing pen. You can even put it in your shirt pocket like one, and it's adorable packaging. You may have more luck if you have very dry eyes, or if you want to use it as a bottom lash eyeliner...but don't expect to make fine-lined wings or artistic designs with it. I have ultra cheap Wet N Wild eyeliner with far more staying power.",True,1,0,1,2

Also I was soaking 2 in acetone, just enough to cover the bristles in a bottle with the lid on it, when I came back to it the handle was all melted and falling apart.

AEV5T3AFMFIUJAT7W2IACLPNXRJA,B000PKKAGO,3.0,"My first impression of the razor was that it was overly packaged. In a day and age in which we're becoming aware of environmental hazards, I don't think there's a need for an outer box enclosing a couple layers of thick hard-to-open plastic wrapping. A strong pair of scissors cut through the lot, and eventually I got to the razor itself.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that it comes with a hard-shell case for travel. This is definitely a good thing to have, though I would have preferred it were only one piece that swivels open and shut, rather than two pieces that have to be separated to open it.<br /><br />The instructions indicate that the charging pod should be unplugged when the razor is fully charged (which takes about an hour). While hardly the worst thing in the world, I don't see why they couldn't have designed it so that it could remain plugged it but turned off. In general, I prefer not to have plugs lying around exposed, especially in the bathroom, where I think most people would tend to keep it. It does have a very clear indicator, though, telling how much longer it needs to charge before reaching the full 65 minutes, and, after a couple weeks of usage, it still did not need to be recharged, so it definitely holds the charge well.<br /><br />The razor itself is stylish and comfortable to hold, and it has a trimmer on the back, which is good for sideburns and the awkward just-under-the-nostrils area.<br /><br />My first shave felt like it took ages, and, half-way through, I seriously considered giving up and getting out my old blade and shaving cream. I decided to stick with it, and, eventually, I figured out that you can't just press it to your face, but press it rather firmly. With more pressure, it eventually got the job done. Subsequent shaves went much easier, and as I got used to using the shaver, the shave-time got less and less. It does a significantly better and faster job on only one day's growth rather than two or three, so it's much more ideal for everyday use than if you tend to go a few days between shaves.<br /><br />Clean-up is easy and fast. Just flip the three razor bits up and rinse with hot water. I'm a little suspicous about using water to clean it each day - I would tend to think it'll rust - but time will tell.<br /><br />After shaving, my face sometimes feels less comfortable than had I used a regular blade and shaving cream, but usually it feels all right. This is the third electric shaver I've owned, and it has been the case with all three that the shave is not as close as even the worst blade I've used. There's really no getting around it: you'll always get a closer shave using a real blade. I'd say this is easily the best of the three electric razors I've used, though, and did a significantly better job on the chin, due to its swiveling head.<br /><br />Overall, I find myself liking this shaver, particularly for the traveling and the cold winter months, when I don't really want to deal with a wet shave in the morning.",False,1,1,1,3
AGB3YZIRHOSAZGQF3NRHKQJWWQTA,B0BTJ6SYKB,5.0,"I really like this. I got a tiny decant of Tom Ford's Black Orchid several years ago and loved it but it didn't really match me very well because it was so fancy and I'm not, so I didn't buy more. This scent reminds me so much of Black Orchid that I wondered if it was designed to be similar. I kind of think it is--lots of the ingredients and notes are exactly the same. Except this scent is less overwhelming and less formal, to my nose, so I feel more comfortable wearing it. It's very warm and sexy without being stinky. If I use one spray it doesn't feel like I'm enveloped in it. They're calling it a gourmand fragrance but what I smell is flowers and wood; the foodie notes (vanilla, etc.) are secondary at most. It's a perfect humid summer night scent if you like deep, warm floral fragrances.",False,1,1,0,2

They stretch enough that you can actually get your fingers in to make a ponytail. I haven't had any break yet but they do stretch out and get 2-3 times as big once you've used them. I do expect them to break after a few uses but I usually lose them after one use anyway. They aren't as resilient as the regular little black bands from the grocery store, and they pull my hair a tiny bit more but they also stay in better. They come in a cute little zipper bag with a slider which is so nice. Every single time I buy loose bands I end up losing most of them because the container they come in is useless.

I accidentally put on too much at one point and for 15 minutes or so until it dried down it kind of smelled like Pine Sol. I think this oil is kind of temperamental. I'm going to be really careful about how much I put on at once.

AGB3YZIRHOSAZGQF3NRHKQJWWQTA,B07WS5QC3D,4.0,"This bag would be PERFECT if it had mesh pockets in the main compartment. I love this style of bag, with the two additional outside pockets, but there aren't a lot of bags in this style and they're all missing something. This one is missing inside pockets. I hope Veckle will add pockets in the future. A slightly smaller everyday bag with a similar design would be great as well.<br /><br />Anyway, this bag seems very well made. It has SBS zippers which all my Gonex bags have as well, and they've all been excellent. I have like 10 Gonex packing cubes that I've stuffed beyond reason, and the zippers are still perfect. So these zippers should last, too. The top zipper has two sliders so you can open it in either direction.<br /><br />The bag is made with lightweight materials without any padding or rigid structure, so you can flatten it. If you pack only a little bit of stuff, it stays small. If you pack a lot, it gets bigger. I love that. The main pocket is just for dumping stuff. There's no organization, which I need, so I won't be able to use this bag as a toiletry kit. There is one outside pocket with mesh so you can put your toothbrush or razor in there while it's wet. The other outside pocket has three little elasticized mesh pockets inside to hold things like eye drops or travel contact solution, or little pill cases. Those are the only sub-organization features in the bag. They're nice just not enough for my stuff.<br /><br />The bag has one closed loop handle that you can hang from a hook. Most of the hotel rooms I've been in recently have one or no hooks, so I learned from my mom to bring a rubber coated S hook with me on trips. They're for holding scarves or whatever on your closet rod.

They do stick very well, and they dissolve under pressure and acetone-it takes a bit of time for that.  The details are really good!  Each sticker sheet measures 3 3/4 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide.  There are some longer stickers - for those with longer nails this is great.

I wish the maker gave an option for a round cuticle area, instead of these square cuticle area nails.  Looking at these from the side, you can see the space between my real nails and the fake nails...so for anyone who has a long nail bed, their real nails will more than likely show as mine do.  I will use these for nail art, I just can't see changing my real nail shape at the side walls to fit these, that can be hazardous.  The curve of these is good, fitting to the nail plate well.

AFJQW6LKQZQMT6IIEOO34ETFWENA,B08NFC4GJN,4.0,"This is a nice Nautical gift set with 4 pretty polishes.  They are 13.5 ml each, and made in the U.S.A.  Initially I thought I would love Stay Nude the most, but it ended up being my least favorite of the set, only because it is pearl and streaks are unavoidable due to the type of finish it is.  All 4 have a shiny topcoat built into the formula.  The 3 cremes are all very sheer formulas, not super opaque.  The thickness of the formula for all of these is good.  If you like a sheer formula, where you can see your nail bed thru the polish, then these are your jam.  I did several manicures with each of them, and found that if I wanted a sheer look then 1 coat worked perfectly, otherwise 2 or 3 coats for full coverage and less peek thru of your natural nail and smile line.  I did 2 easy coats for each of my manicures.  The blue (Hypnosis) seemed to have the best coverage, and the formula for that was my favorite of the 4, it dried the fastest at 8 minutes to the touch.  They all go on easily, with a regular round brush (not flat) and they dry fairly well, in about 10-15 minutes each layer.  I did find that using my own quick drying topcoat that these wore much better, but from the manufacturer neither base nor top coat are required.  I did not get any staining from these, which I love.  The pink and white will both be really good polishes for doing either French tip or pond manicures when you just want a sheer base, where you do a layer, do art over it, then cover it again, and more art on that layer-it gives a layered effect that is fun to do.  The color palate is a fun one, with lots of options for artwork.  These are not quick drying-more of the typical 10 minutes per layer, and I expected them to be hardened on their own, without the help of a quick drying topcoat, but that was not the case with them.",False,1,1,0,2

You should be able to spray down to the last drop.  I tested mine with rubbing alcohol, for sanitizing my phones. The funnel came in handy for filling the bottle. It made the job so easy! The sprayer does spray a very fine mist. I used it several times to clean some things then left it overnight with the cap on. Next day I tested it again. First off, the cap contained some of the rubbing alcohol inside it, which means the container will leak into the cap standing up. Not necessarily a huge deal breaker, but a negative for me. Holding it in my hand I got the rubbing alcohol on my finger too, so this may waste product just from this. Several drops every 24 hours may not seem like a lot, but if you make your own essential oil room spray then this could be an expensive waste. Lastly, I had an issue with the spray top, the angle is so slight I wasn't sure if I would spray myself in the face of I wasn't wearing eyeglasses. You have to be careful, ensuring you're spraying away from yourself. I did not get any leakage of the alcohol out of the cap, it seemed pretty tight.  It did pool in the cap, didn't run down the bottle.  I did get a rubbing alcohol ring when I set down the cap on my coffee table tho.

AGKQETR7UZS7WWMA3LWXBHLY6OGA,B087J6PP9X,4.0,"I really want this on subscribe and save but Amazon only has a couple shades available. :( anyways a few years ago my skin became super sensitive and Almay consistently puts out products that don't bother my skin. This has pretty good coverage and you can build it up. I am rather happy with it. That is the only reason I am not giving it 3 stars. Here is my problem. I am colorblind and finding makeup that matches my skin by myself is a nightmare. For those of you who do not know colorblind is where we have a cone that is low in color which also affects other colors. We do not see in black and white. My green is low sometimes making certain greens look like a light version of goldenrod copy paper or as I say 1970's gold. Yuck... Anyways this affects how I view other colors and I cannot match makeup well. Certain shades will appear the same leading me to believe I have a match until someone (usually my cousin) points out my makeup looks ridiculous. Let me mention my cousins call me &#34;educated&#34; colorblind because most of the time I know how to compensate for color deficiency. I know color theory well. I wrote Almay about the problem because my only alternative was to drag my cousin to the store and have her &#34;sample&#34; shades. I am sure other customers and the store does not appreciate this so in the end I have tons of money wasted on the wrong shades. I know this happens to people with normal color vision but multiple that by 5-10 times you have done that and that describes my experience. Anyways I thought I'd write them and ask as Covergirl used to sell a 3 pack sampler of similar colors so you could find your perfect shade. The reply was to purchase full size products. I thought this lacked empathy as I wasn't writing to get free products. I was writing to find a resolution that would result in me being a long time customer. I don't think them going the extra mile to send something mini even if I had to pay was asking too much from such a large corporation. This leaves me felling like I should rate them 3 stars. While I remain a loyal customer they don't care about me. :( I wouldn't have minded paying for some sort of samples, but I guess they rather keep taking my money while I experienced trial and error finding a shade. Now while my cousins have not compared my makeup to mud since using this shade I haven't exactly had them inspect it closely for me after applied. I will ask to get a final opinion. The smart shade does not provide adequate coverage or I would go that route. I have that product also for lazy days. I rate the product a solid 4 stars for being a good product especially on super sensitive skin, but I rate the company 0 stars for not even considering people like me. They got my money so I guess they're happy. Still let wondering if this is the right shade for me.. *sigh* still holding on to the heap of bottles because I paid good money for it. Anyways I am leaving this review here because this is where I am going to order and the price looks very reasonable. Now if I could find the perfect powder... Btw their concealer sucks. Just use the foundation to build coverage and save your money. I will update after I get some more opinions on if this shade is for me. Gawd I hope it is.

Kind of a greenish-grey pearlescence, and it is a &#34;runny&#34; mask. A little goes a long way, too! I was surprised. There must be at *least* 20 treatments in this little jar. Required less than two teaspoons to do my entire face and under the jawline.<br /><br />It feels strange. Kind of an icy-hot sting in the beginning; interesting, but not uncomfortable. It doesn't feel as though it would do a lot of exfoliating, and it doesn't dry quickly (maybe it's not supposed to dry, at all). The instructions said to leave it on for 20 minutes, but I left it on for an hour. At that point, it was flaky. Rather than simply rinse it off, I rubbed it off with my fingers, and THAT was definitely exfoliating. This wouldn't work with any of the other masks I've used, and I really liked being able to easily/gently rub every bit off using my fingers. Post-rub, my face felt very dry, but after rinsing with warm water that feeling went away and my skin was SO soft.<br /><br />Today when I awoke, my skin felt great. No dry patches. I did still apply my usual three or four drops of cold argan oil, just because the humidity is so low right now.<br /><br />As-is, I like this mask much more than I thought I would when I first opened the jar (though it smells wonderful, again, it's very &#34;liquid,&#34; which seemed strange before I'd actually used it).

AGNASKCAITVBJI2R7UDJR77N3I3A,B000W27068,4.0,"I purchased an sleep mask just like this in a store and, when it went missing, searched for it high and low until I found it here on Amazon. The mask blocks light well with little or no light leaking in around your nose and none around the eyes. The contoured eye coverings place no pressure on your eyelids. I never felt comfortable sleeping in a traditional sleep mask until I used this style. I can even open my eyes in my mask and my lashes don't even brush it.<br /><br />The comfort in wearing meant I quickly adjusted to its use and now can't hardly sleep without it. As someone who has had trouble sleeping and finds napping almost impossible, having the routine of perfect dark when I sleep at night has allowed me to build a trigger. Now, when I need to sleep early, want to catch a nap, find myself in a plane, or other times I might ordinarily find it hard to sleep, I can place my mask on and it signals sleep perfectly. It's improved my sleep length and frequency, as well as reduced the time it takes me to fall asleep, which I think anyone could appreciate.<br /><br />My only gripe is that, while I thought this one was exactly like my previous mask, there's a little difference. There's a little plastic piece on the side of the elastic that joins loops for the adjustment system and they sit very near my ears. I can sometimes feel it digging in and I never remember feeling that on my previous mask. For occasional use, you may not notice it, but using them nightly, the little part can bother me sometimes. My solution plan involves breaking the part and replacing it with something soft or hand-sewing that connection point. Customization is a very small price to pay for the amazingly comfortable contoured foam that makes up the main body of the mask.",True,1,0,1,2

AFY2YY34Z4UBTIQMYJF4B27B4BYQ,B01G450IGA,3.0,Grapefruit scrub for the body and face.  This scrub has ingredients that helps clean your pours and remove toxins.  It can help brighten up your skin and leave a nice healthy fresh glow.  This scrub is rich in essential oils which have many benefits.  The scrub can strengthen your skin and give you protection against more damage from the elements.  The natural salts help exfoliate your skin.  This grapefruit scrub arrived on time and was packaged well.  It didn't have any wrapping around it but there was a top seal to it that you have to take off before use.  It doesn't smell much like grapefruit to me.  It's a little bit bland.  I expected it to be very citrus-y and yummy smelling but it isn't.  It's a very faint grapefruit scent.  I used it and it feels okay on the skin.  It exfoliates well.  The scrub was very hard to remove and it left my skin very oily feeling.  I had to wash the oil off of my skin.  I tried it on some dry skin areas and it does help those areas.  It exfoliates the dry skin and leaves a nice softness to those areas.  That is what I will continue using this product for as the oil feeling is just too much on already healthy skin.  Overall I found this body scrub to be too oily but works great on dry areas.  It also doesn't have a strong scent.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.

AF6P4UNCGFPI67T2USLYZCHL3VEA,B083G6JDJH,2.0,"Overall, I liked this sheet mask but I would not buy it again because it was so heavily fragranced that I couldn’t bear it for more than 5 minutes. This mask is the first mask I’ve seen which contains kaolin clay. You leave the mask on like any other sheet mask, but after you take off the mask, you can see a thin layer of gray clay on your face. You have to rinse that off.  After I rinsed off the mask and applied my usual Cerave cream moisturizing cream, I felt that my skin looked noticeably brighter.<br /><br />These masks are expensive. They cost $6.00 each (a pack of 5 costs $30.00 on Amazon). Although the two-piece mask fit my face, did not slide off, and is the only sheet mask I know which incorporates kaolin, I found the floral, perfume fragrance overwhelming. A sheet mask should be enjoyable and not make you want to hold your breath.<br /><br />Instead of buying this mask again, I want to try clay/kaolin/bentonite masks and continue to use masks with some of the same ingredients as this mask (e.g., niacinamide (brightens skin but can be irritating for some people), allantoin (soothing), centella asiatica extract (soothing), and dipotassium glycyrrhizate (potential brightening effect)).<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE CLAY MASK: I highly recommend the ISNTREE Real Mugwort Clay Mask* ($23.60 for 3.38 fl oz). There is a strong earthy, herbal scent when you apply the mask, but it disappears quickly. I noticed decreased redness using this mask. It has been more effective than any sheet mask I have tried.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE SHEET MASKS: To brighten skin, try Keana Nadeshiko Rice Mask 10 Pieces Japan** (10 sheets for $9.50). The fragrance free masks contain glycerin (moisturizing), rice ferment filtrate (sake) and rice bran for a skin brightening effect.<br /><br />* https://www.amazon.com/Blackheads-Whiteheads-Moisturizing-Sensitive-Extracts/dp/B07KQYWBP7/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3BHFM1SJVHDQD&keywords=innisfree+clay+mask&qid=1656954243&sprefix=innisfree+clay+mask%2Caps%2C43&sr=8-7<br /><br />** https://www.amazon.com/Keana-Nadeshiko-Rice-Pieces-Japan/dp/B018FM03CO/ref=psdc_11061121_t1_B00IFROMCM<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.

AF7IQNPKNY4Z7TIKXOB7S5GZ6D7A,B000EPUQKK,5.0,"I replaced my Norelco Spectra with this Smart-Touch 9190 XL and it works as advertised. I liked the Spectra, but compared to it the XL simply outclasses the old one.<br /><br />The XL takes less time, shaves closer and is quieter. It also has a much bigger chamber to hold the cut hair. And the trimmer works well. According to the manual, it takes up to 3 weeks to conform to your skin and you may get some irritation until it gets broken in. I set it to sensitive and have had very little skin irritation from day one.<br /><br />It has some nice features including a screen that tells you how many minutes you have used and how many you have left. Or, you can change the display to a battery indicator. It also tells you when to rinse, charge the razor and change the blades. Another nice feature is the travel lock. You hold the power button for 3 seconds and it locks which prevents it from accidentally turning on. The charging base has a little clock, but I do not see the point in that.<br /><br />My old razor had the digital information screen so that is what I wanted in a new razor. However, if you do not need or want that feature then I would suggest getting the cheaper model. I think all the other features are the same on both, plus you would save a lot of money. Personally, I like the 9190XL but the choice is up to you.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Faster shave.<br /><br />Closer shave.<br /><br />Information screen.<br /><br />Easily rinses clean.<br /><br />Holds charge for a long time.<br /><br />Quiet operation.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Pricey.",True,1,0,1,2

AETD4B3NZCZICXNC7LY7UZ5RUWFQ,B01AQ41GKW,4.0,"I really like this palette, but feel it should be noted that it is NOT as expected. Very nice colors, but more subdued than bold, more satin/shimmer than metallic.  This is my first Ulta palette and I am happy with the quality.  I only deducted one star because the colors are somewhat other than expected.  I paid $12.<br /><br />I specifically bought it for the green color, and I still like the green color, but it's not as bright or as metallic as the collection name caused me to expect.  The finish is something of a shimmering satin, not metallic.  The colors are somewhat subdued.  The package says &#34;jewel tones&#34; which may be more accurate than the &#34;metals&#34; description, but still (to me) implies more brightly colored shades, with fewer earth tones.  I would also expect a &#34;jewel toned&#34; palette to include a strong purple, and this only has the lilac (Dynasty). (The Royal looks purple but swatched brown with a hint of burgundy.) The colors are more woodsy than jeweled.  The green is more mossy than emerald, the purple more floral than jeweled, the blue more night sky than sapphire.<br /><br />The quality of the shadows is good.  Neither buttery nor powdery, it's a slightly dry formula that nevertheless doesn't kick up a lot of product or cause a lot of fall out.  I wear them over a primer, but I have been happy with their wear time.  As stated above, pigmentation is good in that you don't have to build heavily, but it's also not a bright coloring.<br /><br />A lovely bonus is that I actually love the brush that comes with this item!  How often do you say that about a brush in a palette?  It's not only soft and usable, it's unique among my brush collection.  It's flufflier and less flat that most brushes of it's size, and it's also smaller and more pinpointed that most brushes that have a bit of fluffiness to them.  Overall, I feel like it gives good control while still blending well.  It's quickly become a favorite brush.<br /><br />There may have been a naming crisis when creating this palette, lol.  As the palette name is Metals, the subtitle is Jewels, and every individual shade is named with a royalty/gentry theme.  The shares are: Noble (white), Lady (pale pink), Reign (earthy pink), Crown (gold), Dynasty (lilac), Royal (brown), Honor (platinum), Jester (silver), Armor (bronze),  Fortress (green), Duchess (navy), and Duke (off black).  No mattes, all satin/shimmer.  All smooth, no fall out, some apply more evenly than others (drier formula).  Swatched dry on dry skin in photo.  Will build to brighter, more shiny finish.<br /><br />I ordered this palette on a whim, and I've enjoyed it.  However, if you are wanted super metallic finishes or bright colors, you should manage your expectations.",True,1,1,1,3

Also another thing I really didn't care for was that the light some cells were not even really that great I got brighter lights in my bathroom to help pluck my eyebrows the only thing this helps with his getting that close to mirror without having it looking at my face into the mirror in the bathroom. But the mirror itself is actually really good I just wish the lights would have been a lot brighter also I like how you were able to dim the lights that was kind of a cool feature but I kind of wish you would have came with a cord instead of just run off regular batteries because nobody wants to change batteries in the middle of doing their eyebrows because the lights went out on their mirror and hopefully you end up having some.

I used it once and I was not impressed at all. It’s very cute and the perfect shade of light pink. But functionality was not there. I put my china glaze nail polish in it and put it on my middle and ring fingers of my left hand and started to paint my toe nails. Nothing bad happened but it really wasn’t better than just setting the bottle on the table. So I’m giving it 3 stars for the cute factor, and the fact that it held the polish fine.

The usual vinyl suction cups On pillows normally start failing within weeks as vinyl hardens in heat and soon stop providing suction. This had been true no matter the cost of the pillow. The material on this pillow feels like silicone, such as that on kitchen ware. In fact, it is as temperature tolerant as a silicone potholder! The suction cups, which is  molded as part of the pillow (not just attached onto the pillow), truly provide incredible suction. Bath oil usually sticks onto other pillows’ woven fabrics and even under the suction cups. But being that here, the suction is so strong, the oils won’t sneak underneath the cups. Even the surface of this pillow does not allow oils and soap scum to stick onto it. (would have loved to see a larger version of this such as one size of a clawfoot tub back). This pillow allows one to open the back up (for cleaning?). It was inspected after 3 straight months of daily usage with oils, etc...not a single grain of scum and oil stuck inside. Hence, no fear of mold, etc. It is not s super cushiony pillow, but rather, a support pillow. And if staying put and cleanliness is high on your list, this is fantastic!",True,1,0,1,2

AFOJD7MOGTB4BDLIC3BCFVM3APAA,B005V3AUK6,4.0,"I've been using Bare Escentuals &#34;Bare Minerals&#34; mineral makeup since about 2002. I've tried other brands but till now I just didn't find anything I liked as much, let alone better. Lately though the BE makeup just hasn't been agreeing with my skin. I'm getting older and my skin is a bit more sensitive these days apparently. The one thing I never cared for with the BE makeup was their use of bismuth. Anything with bismuth it just makes my skin itch. I've been reading about the negatives of parabens too, and I decided I wanted to get away from that as much as I could.<br /><br />BE doesn't have that but it does use bismuth, at least they did as of the last time I ordered a big kit. After perusing Amazon and reading ingredient lists I chose to try this kit. Mainly because of the fact that this makeup doesn't have any of that and reviews here already are mostly positive. Also because I liked the eye shadow colors in the trial kit. These are colors I'd use a lot so I didn't feel like I was wasting money on colors I'd never use just to get trials on everything else. The jars are about the size of a BE eyeshadow, a little smaller maybe. The brushes weren't bad but they are small. I put them in my purse kit. They're useful for that, but not for much else. But they're sturdy. They're not losing bristles and they seem fairly soft.<br /><br />For the most part I like this makeup. It's about the same grind as the BE mineral makeup, feels a bit silkier to me actually. It smells about the same seems maybe a bit less noticeable, the smell. It blends as well, but doesn't feel quite as heavy. The finishing veil is good. I have combination skin and oil in my t-zone and it did a good job of keeping me matte all day. The foundation covers well and doesn't make my face itch at all. The bisque is okay but I don't think it's got quite the coverage of the BE bisque. I did have to use more of it to cover things the same way. I kind of wish this kit had come with sample jars of the colored concealers as I would have liked to have tried those combined with their bisque. I think it might have worked better with that combo. I'm admittedly at a point where a simple bisque concealer is probably not enough for me. I'm getting dark under eye areas and have some red I need to cover now and again.<br /><br />Their &#34;glow&#34; mixed with the pink blush is my new blush. It's too much for me as a bronzer. I have very pale ivory skin and it just does not work for me all over. Just a little too much orange, a little too dark but it did work okay as blusher over the pink they send you. Combining both that gave me a blusher that worked well for me. The pink blush they give you is just way too light and frosted for me. It just doesn't show up at all. It was the one product in the kit I just did not care much for. I would definitely want a darker more mauve or cinnamon toned blush rather than this one. The pink on it's own is pretty useless. I had to combine the two or forget it. It didn't even look like I had any color on my cheeks.<br /><br />The foundation colors are decent. Their Fair #1 is actually a near perfect match for me but I'd probably never use the Fair #2 unless it was combined with the Fair #1 maybe. My skin is never that dark, not even in Summer. But Fair #1 I must admit I like that one. It's hard for me to find a foundation that's fair enough that's not too yellow, but Fair #1 works well. Fair #2 is just a tad too dark and just a bit yellow for me.<br /><br />Overall I'd have to say this kit was a positive experience except for a couple of colors being slightly off for me. I do plan on ordering a big kit but I'm also going to email them and ask if they might send a slightly darker blush and just the Fair #1 x2 instead since they're supposedly picking the cosmetics as they pack for you. Can't hurt to ask, and if they do then their &#34;Fair&#34; kit will work very well for me and I can see myself becoming a regular with this one. I did not expect this product to be as good as it is actually. It was a very pleasant surprise. I'm used to spending a lot more on the BE product. This is much less expensive and in some ways I think I actually like it better than BE so I probably won't be a BE customer much now that I've discovered this.",True,1,0,1,2

Just for clarification  there is a Loose Wave and a Deep Loose Wave. I have woren borh.<br /> So after unpacking , the loose wave  bundles were beautiful until I took it out of the net.... the curl dropped.. What was even more disappointing  was the tangling/manageability  and how dead/dry the ends were. Testing, by lightly -medium spraying with water and letting dry,I was able to see how much wave /curl  was left.... No curl and was puffy/bushy very little to no wave . Usually with  loose wave you can wash and go. Not the case here. I also noticed that some bundles lighten faster than the others. During the lightening process there was a toxic chemical smell,  yellow residue  and I noticed the hair was REALLY  hot to the touch and there was a sizzling sound that made me extremely alarmed .. I immediately rinsed in luke warm water. Was afraid to process again so that I could get the potential color want not knowing if the  hair was going burn  due to how hot the hair was during the first process. Good thing it's for myself and not a paying client so Im fine with the color that I have. There isn't any unusual shedding  even after the lightening process BUT it's still early!<br /> To sum things up... I do not recommend  using this company.  Trust and integrity means a great deal in the business word. As a consumer on Amazon did read the vendors return policy  before placing my order AND ALL of the hair vendors have the same policy BUT what I can't understand is how was I supposed to know the hair wasn't as the vendors description and have the problems that occurred without  disturbing the bundles?  I would have to give a refund if this was for paying client!! The vendor return policy implies they hold no responsibility for misrepresentation in the description so if once you've disturbed the hair... that's it!

I use it on counters, phones, keyboards, jewelry, leather chair, and am about to use it on wood floors (although I will wipe after a minute so area doesn't remain wet).  and many other things.  It does not sting as would alcohol based  products if you have cuts on your hands, and from what I have researched, it will actually help heal them!  A family member used it on her little daughter's eczema, and it cleared it up!  Use it on shopping cart handles and even on restaurant utensils especially during flu season.  No wiping necessary is a great convenience, also, so long as the surface will not be harmed when remaining wet for a length of time.  Constructive Criticism:  The bottles could be improved. Sometimes they are hard to open and close.  The plastic edge is sharp and you need to be careful when struggling with this as it can hurt your hand (especially if wet).  The stream setting on the bottle is useless to me and, in fact, is annoying since one has to remember which way to turn the nozzle for the regular spray or it will be necessary to turn often hard to turn on-off part back to off and then on again, turning it to the spray side.  The little bottles are overpriced, and it the company suggests not refilling from larger bottles, although they do seem to think it is OK if you are careful not to contaminate anything.  Would be nice if they did not discourage this as one is paying so much to be sure the product is effective.  It would also be great to have expiration dates printed on the label.

But, removing the gel polish is the worst part or the thing I hate about gel polish: it's time consuming and so hard on the nail bed. I've seen mixed reviews online about gel polish steamers but I finally decided to try one.<br />This gel polish remover machine actually works. It was easy to put together and I was able to completely remove my gel polish in under 20 minutes. First and most important is to file the top layer of gel down first with a nail file before using this device. I was not able to get the gel polish offf without filing the surface first. I put about two capfuls of 100% acetone (you can use less) into the little tray and turned the machine on. Once it beeps, you can stick your fingers inside. It gets a little hot but it's not painful. After five minutes the machine will beep and I am able to scrape off most of the gel polish. I have to do a second round to get certain areas that just won't scrape off. And when I say scrape off, I mean easily scrape off not scraping and hurting the surface of the nail. I guess I should say push off the gel polish to remove it. I leave the remaining acetone in the tray and either reuse it or dump it. I would say this is easier than using aluminum foil or plastic nail caps because you do the whole hand at once. With foil or plastic caps, I never get my whole hand done at once. This was easier and I didn't use any cotton balls and I used less acetone.<br /><br />The device is a little pricey. It's basically a warming plate fitted inside a contained area with holes to place your fingers. It's worth the money to me because I hate the process of gel removal. I  like that the company provides four replacement plastic pieces for the nail holes. It took me a while to figure out what the replacement pieces were for but after reading one of the reviews I now realize what it's used for. There is also a second plastic tray to put the nail polish remover or acetone in. My only criticism is that I wish the device was smaller as I have a lot of nail stuff and this will just add to it all. It's not the fanciest looking device but it does the job.",False,1,0,1,2

AF43N4ZO3WVBCWUZSBABG2YYGQTA,B01MTQW0BK,5.0,"I will start out by saying that I did not purchase my Wahl Smart Shaver from Amazon since I found it cheaper elsewhere.  With that being said, I'd like to comment based on my usage of this shaver thus far. First of all, I just recently used a Braun 9 series shaver. Unfortunately, this shaver does not have a cleaning/charging station but I'm not convinced that is a deal breaker. I am also puzzeld by some of the negative reviews here. I literally turned on both shavers, and in my honest opinion, the Wahl was slightly quieter. The Wahl does have some similarities to a Remington shaver. For example, the two inner blades resemble the Remington as does the sound of the shaver. The outter foil seems to be very unique to the Wahl brand. So in using the Wahl Smart Shaver, I found it to be very effective on 2+ days of beard growth as it went through the facial hair with ease. The shaver head is thinner which in my opinion allowed me to get closer than both Braun and Remington shavers. The hypoallergenic foils that have symmetrical and asymmetrical foil slots provided me with an exceptionally close and clean shave. Almost 12 hours after my initial shave, and I barely felt any stubble growth. To me that speaks volumes about this shaver. I was very skeptical about trying this shaver based on the prior reviews here and the fact that the Wahl shaver was cheaper than the leading brands (e.g., Braun, Panasonic, Remington, etc..). However, for now I'm glad I took a chance and decided to give the Wahl Smart Shaver a chance. Also, if you view other sites, this shaver ranks significantly higher than it does amongst Amazon shoppers. Not sure why this is but something doesn't make sense to me. So if you want a clean shave and also don't want to go into debt buying a shaver, I suggest giving this shaver a try. By the way I'm retired military and this would've been nice to use while I was active duty. Lastly, if you're still not convinced, please take into account that Wahl guarantees this shaver for five (5) years. Take a chance. You'll be glad you did!",False,1,0,1,2

It is actually the color of a mink, too. Dark brown with a hint of red. The wave and bounce is nice. Thick, realistically long, and a full head of generous hair.  The fit is good with adjustable straps on the inside. The thing is tho...the thickness just looks a little fake at the top with a center part and no bangs or shorter pieces in the front. Yes, I believe I could trim it or pluck it or something but I am inexperienced at that and I never have done that to my wigs. I have washed them and gently brushed them and trimmed one piece out of the eye area, but this one would need more work than I know how to do in the front and center to make it look natural. It is a single uniform colour, which makes it look a little fake to me. I think this one looks great from the back and side and on the bed just lying there next to my other wigs, as I was trying my collection on today to compare. This one stood out as silky and luxury and rich and deep in colour because I mostly go blonde. But it just doesn't look real when on (me? Maybe it's just me?). I'm sorry. But I still like it.

This item is heavier, noisier and more inconvenient than its predecessor. And for practically no gain! This shaver catches maybe 10% of the clipped hair with the rest of it flying all over the sink.<br /><br />Stay away from this model.<br /><br />Update: I've owned Norelco trimmers in the past, however based on my experience with this particular model, my next trimmer will NOT be a Norelco. The fan which drives the vaccuum rattles against the plastic housing, making a hideous noice while I'm trimming. The vaccuum action is terrible; hairs don't make it down into the receptacle, causing constant blockage. This in turn, scatters hair all over the place, worse than any conventional non-vac trimmer I've ever owned. (And no, my beard is not especially thick either.) I've finally had it with this model. I'm about to order a new trimmer on Amazon. No, it won't be a Norelco.",False,1,0,1,2
AHVPB5DFCZX3ELRYWZEAO2DK65JQ,B000068PBM,4.0,"This Norelco (actually made by Philips) one was bought to replace an older shaver (I've used Norelco, Philips and Panasonics over the years.) This one is more efficient (faster, better shave) than my older one, and an amazingly amount quieter. What do you know- this time, &quot;new and improved&quot; really is accurate!<br />What I like: the shaver fits the hand well, the pivoting blade heads fit the face and as a result shave quite well. The battery strength indicator, consisting of bright LEDs showing the percentage of charge remaining in 20% increments, is very useful, and the flip-up hinged shaver head section is easy to clean with warm water (I still have to consciously force myself to do this!) They have also &quot;shrunk&quot; the half-egg shaped power transformer, and you can use 100 - 220 volts to plug / charge, a good thing for someone who travels globally as I do.<br />What I don't like: the pop-up trimmer is only fair - it works, but it's actually not as effective as the one on my old shaver! The deep well holding the head rotors shafts is not so easy to clean with a brush, particularly with the hinged head; they are still using a non-user replaceable NiCd battery; the gimmicky cutter head plate section with holes seems merely that - gimmicky, not useful for any real shaving.<br />Tips: After cleaning the head / blade assemblies, allow them to dry fully and spray-lubricate with something like &quot;Shaver Saver.&quot; When power seems low, turn the shaver on and allow to discharge fully before reccharging - these are, after all, still NiCd batteries with the &quot;memory&quot; effect. These tips have allowed my previous electrics' battery - and cutter head assemblies - to last a long time (I have a heavy beard - even with a blade shaver, I have to shave again in the afternoon if I have a dinner appointment.)<br />Recommendation: This is a very good, easy to use, quick and quiet electric shaver - the best I have ever used. It packs easily for travel, and though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do.

So far I’ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I’ve seen a tiny bit of results. You’re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven’t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I’ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity.

Normally, with high quality extensions like Bellami brand (for example, i do have these extensions as well which are close to 300$ at 200grams of hair, however they are VERY long which is why I found these because I needed a 14inch length) you can dye them darker if you NEED to. I would never trust dying these. They are soft, but don't feel durable and the strips are really thin. They do feel like real hair, and they are soft and shiny and look very very real, but using heat styling products on them and coloring them I would NOT do it. Also, I would recommend buying 4 packs if you have thick hair like I do.

Overall I am pleased with this epilator and will continue to use it.<br /><br />There are only a few small cons to the product. This only comes with one head and the exfoliating brush. For the price, they just include a few different heads. For some reason though, Braun has decided to make multiple epilators that seem to be the same, but each comes with a different head, rather than just making one product that comes with all the different choices. In my opinion they are just doing this to make more money.<br /><br />The other cons were things that Braun has always done and doesn't seem to want to change.

In my case, almost 20 years! So this hair straightener/brush combo is brilliant and has cut down on my morning hair prep by at least 15-20 minutes! More importantly, this is a smart and effective straightener. You can program your desired heat settings, and it took less than 3 minutes for the brush to heat up. I really love the fact that the bristles stayed cool enough so that my hands didn't burn when they touched the heated brush. I also didn't notice the brush lose any heat as I put it down, worked on wet spots, or redid a difficult component (I was trying to do one of those chic, top-buns that require your hair to be extremely straight before it goes into the bun). I usually have to wait for other straighteners to reheat after each use or after I put it down, but that wasn't the case with this straightener.<br /><br />I have medium density hair, so the brush straightened it immediately, but the bristles are deep enough that even the thickest hair could be straightned with little effort on your part. I also really appreciate how quickly the brush cooled down after I finished, so I can easily store it back in the fabric bag that came with the brush. I also love the hair clips they provided (the exact same as those used at my hair salon) so that I could hold up my top layers of hair while I straightened the hair at the bottom of my crown. Like everything else with this straightener, the combs were so well thought out that they fit into the bag with the straightener, so I could easily store the entire setup in a drawer, rather than cluttering my countertop.

The slight curve allows for the in to rest against the curve of your head. The length is nice, and allows more versatility.<br /><br />What I don't like is the material. For $10 at Target, I wasn't expecting something industrial but the material is very, very flimsy and not remotely sturdy. Not only that, maybe it's the coating on the pins, these things don't stay in for long, or at all sometimes. I have fine, long hair and these pins won't stay put if I don't use product. I usually use a leave-in conditioner so that helps to create texture and the pins seem to stay in longer. These might work better with coarse, thicker hair.

I applied this dye and didn't leave it on exceptionally long,  from start to finish maybe one hour 20 minutes.  The box says 40, but I read that some people left it on for hours.  Rinsing it off did not cause any staining in the shower as the color was not super dark.  I was pleasantly surprised with the mild color change when it dried.  My hair was shinier and the silver color changed the white to a nice shade of silver and the yellowish color was  95% gone.  Plus there was no awful smell.  I have had to wash it a couple of times already and I believe it is fading, but I am okay with that as I didn't expect it to last a long time.

AGSCB7MHIBVX6JVOWUJQZIFPOZHQ,B00K1SGTLA,5.0,"I'm 45 and my skin has changed dramatically over the past 5 years.  I had to move from loose powder coverage to more of a &#34;foundation&#34; coverage to hid all the flaws.  After trying several different products, I came across this product from Avon.  So, it's a cream foundation that goes on very smooth.  I only apply it in the morning and find that if I don't mess with my face too much, it stays all day.  It covers very well.  All the little sun damage spots, redness, etc are covered evenly and smoothly. It doesn't look like you have a foundation mask on, but I also apply it down along my jaw line and neck to make sure.<br /><br />There are two cons to this product: 1) it tends to accentuate fine lines until it settles.  I use a magnifying mirror and you can see the make-up in the creases.  From farther away, it's not that bad.  I also notice that as it settles into my skin, that seems to fade.  2) I have combination skin, and it feels oily on my skin after a few hours.  It does not cause breakouts (actually, my skin is so much better since I started using this product), so I don't think it's doing anything, but just feels a little oily.  It doesn't LOOK oily, it just feels oily and I can't wait to get home and wash my face.  I'm not a foundation user, so this may be typical, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this product.  The coverage is fantastic and far outweighs the minor &#34;cons&#34; I have listed above.  Since I only apply it once a day, on work days usually, it lasts a long time.  It comes with a round sponge and mirror compact.  It is definitely Avon quality.",True,1,1,1,3

The mouthpiece is like having a sports mouthguard in and is barely noticeable after you've had it in for a minute or so.<br /><br />Because you can wear it around your neck, it is therefore hands-free and you can go about other tasks while you're wearing it - which is helpful, because the treatments are four back-to-back 8-minute sessions; so it is 32 minutes altogether, every day for up to 10 days. If you're doing other things, you don't even notice that you have it on; the device glows when it is on and blinks when a session has ended.<br /><br />We found the taste of the whitening gel to be pleasant, kind of sweet, minty. You don't have to try to not swallow while you're wearing this - it's perfectly fine to swallow some of the whitening gel - I did and there was no stomach upset or anything because of it.<br /><br />The blue glow is kind of neat, like something from a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />The whole thing - vials, device and mouthpiece, and instruction book come in a handy travel or storage case.<br /><br />We really liked i!

AHOIEGJN2E4PSERES6JGZWQCRLJQ,B01N04LXAU,1.0,I wish I could give this -☆ because it's awful. Let's start with the fact that I ordered the pink one & I was sent this tacky gold one. That would've been forgivable had the product not been such HORRIBLE quality. As seen in the pics the pin in the hinge is breaking away from the product itself. This is causing the compact to not seal correctly & start closed. Then the cover that closes over the actual foundation will not seal resulting in foundation  that drys out really quickly. I'm beyond irritated & hope this review steers you in another direction. I tired to give it an honest try even though I could see the issues. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$,True,1,0,1,2
AHR4YEI45WT5VDPEEREQD4UIU5EA,B00LFWMA82,2.0,"I have bought almost every other oil from 'The 2 Bits Man' and this is by far the worst one. I read reviews on this one like 'It smells like burnt wood' or 'The Canoeist beard oil smells like birch and cedar'. Either you guys are paying people to write reviews, or I received a bad bottle of oil. I guess it could be that my wife and I have a different sense of smell than everyone else? We both agree that it literally smells like damp cardboard. If you take the box it came in, soak it in water, tear it, then smell where you tore it, that's what it smells like.<br /><br />Being from the south, I know what &#34;burnt wood&#34; and or &#34;cedar&#34; smell like... it isn't even close. I guess I could smell the birch... but it smells like wet, old birch firewood that has been sitting outside for a good while.<br /><br />The ONLY reason why I gave it two stars is because its better than the unscented jojoba oils you can buy. Also, the outside of the bottle was completely soaked with oil when I got it. I assume this was from being on a plane with the pressure changes that caused some of the oil to seep out and get all over it. The cap was kind of crooked under the seal so maybe that was why?",True,1,1,1,3
AEMU5H3PF76L2USYGMN2GCQOP7WA,B00KGZS3K8,5.0,"This Hylo-Forte eye drop is nothing short of miraculous for me.  My eyes have been continuously gritty, itchy, dry, red and even blurry at times no matter what I did or what eye drops I used.  I read that eye drops containing hyaluronic acid, (which Hylo-Forte does) were recommended by the head of the  Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute.  So I ordered Hylo-Forte and some other preservative free drops suitable for carrying in pocket or purse.  When my order arrived I immediately read the package insert for the Hylo-Forte and put the first drop in my right eye which all that day had felt like there was a grain of sand in it every time I blinked.  I was astonished!!! The ""grit"" immediately disappeared and I quickly put a drop in the other eye.  The effect lasted for many hours with none of the previously mentioned symptoms apparent.  The package said the drops could be used up to 3 times a day, so even tho I probably didn't need to, I put them in my eyes before watching TV in the evening and again before bed.  In the morning the vision in one of my eyes was cloudy (as has been the usual case), but within 10 minutes of using the drops that cleared up and I have not used another dose for the rest of the day.  My eyes have continued to be comfortable, moist feeling and symptom free all day.  Additionally, the product has a very clever dispensing system which dispenses exactly one pre-measured drop per pump.  It's a very  nice feature since the bottle only contains10ml and I wouldn't want to waste any.

AGBBAT7D5L7QBWNDNYAQLECBNVIA,B000050FDE,4.0,"The nice thing about this toothbrush is that it uses the same heads as most of Oral-B's other toothbrushes.  This is a basic model, which probably cleans just as well as their other models.  The battery lasted me about a week of twice a day brushing, and the battery indicator tells you when you'll need to recharge it a few brushing sessions in advance.  Don't ignore it too long, because it takes about 18 hours to charge it fully, but charging it about an hour should be good enough for one brushing.  The charger is small and doesn't take up much room in a drawer.<br /><br />The small head really works well for cleaning the sides of your teeth and between them.  Oral-B talks about the cupping action and it really works like the polishing tools most hygienists use.  It even seemed to dig food particles stuck between my teeth(!), but you'll still want to floss where no toothbrush can reach.  If you have gum issues, this may be the ideal toothbrush for you.<br /><br />The dual clean head got my teeth acceptably clean faster, but it's noticeably bigger and the precision clean head worked better overall for me. It's nice that they included two different brush heads so you can see which you prefer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the slower pulsing action seems to irritate my teeth.  A week or two after I started using this toothbrush, my molars started to ache. I ended up returning it and going back to my other Oral-B, whose head looks more like a normal toothbrush which vibrates up & down very quickly.  It doesn't clean along the gum line quite as well, but seems to clean the grinding surfaces of molars slightly better.<br /><br />Oral-B also sells softer toothbrush heads which people seem to like and may be better for my sensitive teeth.<br /><br />I added another star for Amazon's good customer service and considering that most people don't seem to have sensitive teeth.  In general, just about any electric toothbrush will do a much better job cleaning your teeth, removing plaque, etc., etc. - much better than a manual brush.  Try one.

I'm not entirely sure about its claims about dealing with skin issues like acne, as I'm a bit nervous to put this on my face. I figure that it could certainly be used for the occasional acne that shows up elsewhere (we all get it), as tea tree is well known for being a good way to treat acne. Still, I have heard that the base oil is good for skin as well, so that is a plus as well.<br /><br />The main minus I have here is that while the smell here isn't awful, it's still strong enough that it gave me a bit of a headache. (That's another reason I probably won't be using it on my face.) I was able to deal with this by putting it on in small bits, which seemed to work well since the strongest part of the smell faded away pretty quickly. The remaining scent is honestly pretty nice and mellow.<br /><br />I do have to commend the company for their packaging. While the bottle did leak during transport, the company was aware that this would happen ahead of time and packaged this well. I do wish that it didn't leak, but barring this I do appreciate that it was properly packaged so that the small amount of oil that leaked didn't get everywhere.",False,1,1,0,2

There's only one button on this, although it's surrounded by several lights that give off the impression that they should also be buttons, which is very slightly confusing at first. It's easy to change between temperatures and the unit heats up incredibly quickly, which is awesome.<br /><br />The downside to this is that the design makes it more difficult to lay down on the counter - if you have a sink that is slightly raised then you can prop it up against that, but I do wish it had something like some of the curling irons have.  It also comes with a small bag, but I'm slightly worried about putting the straightener in the bag if it's even slightly warm, as it's the type of material that could melt easily.<br /><br />I'm not really familiar with straighteners in general, but this does seem like it's designed to be similar to some of the more name brand, expensive items out there.

AFAAY32MQYRA56IVSVNSCDLNE62A,B07JCYGJC3,4.0,"I've had water flossers before - they're honestly pretty fantastic since they can get in places and in pockets where regular floss can't. If you get the right one and know how to use it, it's a lot like having your own dental assistant to help clean your teeth. My last water flosser gave up the ghost after I dropped it while moving (RIP water flosser!) so this seemed like it'd be good to try out.<br /><br />Upon using this I immediately noticed that the lowest setting wasn't shooting out water hard enough for me, so I turned it up to the max. That worked better, but it still didn't have the oomph that its larger counterparts did. So if you're looking for a particularly intense water flosser, this isn't really going to be it. On the other hand, this would probably do well with people who want lower pressure.<br /><br />The fact that this is handheld is pretty nice, although it does take a while to get used to since I'm used to the smaller water flosser nozzles. It's a bit like holding a really huge toothbrush in some aspects, if that makes any sense. The water being in the unit is an OK feature but if you like being very thorough and doing several passes, you'll more than likely need to refill at some point. That part isn't a big hardship as filling this up is a breeze and one of the nicest aspects of it. It's insanely easy to do and isn't needlessly complicated.<br /><br />In the end the main draw for this would be that I can take it with me on trips, which I almost certainly will. It's far easier to pack into a travel bag or throw into a suitcase than a standard water flosser with a huge tank would be. I just don't think that I'd prefer this for daily use over a more traditional unit, especially since I like my water pressure a lot higher than that.

I'm always a little leery of brushing since I don't want to ruin my brushes or potentially harm my nightguard. Soaking it in some mouthwash is helpful, but then that isn't the same as a thorough clean.<br /><br />The taste of this is fairly nice. I like that it's not extremely overwhelming. You can wipe your guard down and it won't be insanely strong. There will be a hint of flavor, but overall it's not going to be anything that will knock your socks off. This might be disappointing for some, but it's still a better thing to taste than the alternative.

It's not a miracle worker, but then I wasn't expecting it to be and to be honest, I'd be more than a little leery of something that would remove all the yellowing immediately.

As of now, the SpeedXL is still in perfect working order and it's likely to be one of my kids first shavers when they are going to need a first shaver (soon).<br /><br />I am writing this only to testify to the quality of this product. I had no problems with it whatsoever, it never let me down, the battery still holds enough charge for maybe half a dozen shaves, runs as silently as on day one and it's a near-zero maintenance item, requiring nothing beyond the heads cleaning after each shave by placing them under the faucet. The one issue I had was that the skin on my neck got irritated from time to time but it was never anything major that wouldn't go away after a few hours.<br /><br />Si, it's goodbye to the SpeedXL for me (hello Arcitec) but it's not this shaver's end of career. It's going to be in service, again, in about a year or two, who knows for how much longer :)",True,1,1,1,3
AEHOFUNZP6VT74RUDDCJ2VVIT56A,B000PKNPES,4.0,"The Arcitec is replacing my almost 3 year old [[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Philips Norelco Speedxl Men's Shave]] which served me well for all this time but, when the time came to replace the old 8140XL's heads I happened to notice that a brand-new Arcitec was available as a 'lightning deal' for some $35 more so I took advantage of the opportunity. After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is 'better' that the 8140XL and I am therefore pleased with my purchase. While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same 'lift and cut' technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.<br /><br />But, let's go into some details:<br /><br />PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND PRESENTATION<br /><br />The shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer. It's not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don't suffer any damage while in transit.<br /><br />Inside I found:<br /><br />- The shaver itself<br />- Super-protective (for travel mostly) charging pod<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- Charging stand<br />- Sliding razor head cap<br />- 100/240V power cord<br />- User manual and warranty statement (English/Spanish)<br />- Quick start guide card<br /><br />Taking the shaver out of its packaging, understanding its operation and making it work was relatively easy.<br /><br />The manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it's a 1050). It covers everything, from features, charging options, shaving tips and techniques, cleaning, storage and replacement of the razor head. I've actually read it and I am better off for it.<br /><br />FEATURES AND OPERATION<br /><br />Charging<br />--------<br />This is one of Arcitec's better features. The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged. I didn't count shaving minutes but, at least with a brand-new battery you won't need to recharge it very often. In 'emergencies', just 3 minutes of charging should give you 3 minutes of shave time.<br /><br />There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec's precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue. After all these years the battery still allows me to shave several times before a recharge is needed.<br /><br />You charge your shaver by either placing it on the charging stand or inside the charging pod. Philips recommends that you do not keep the charging stand continuously connected to the power outlet and I have no problem with that. One one-hour charge session keeps my shaver going for several weeks (I only shave 2-3 times per week).<br /><br />Shaving<br />--------<br />The feature most of us buy a shaver for :)... It's okay, for an electric shaver. I won't say that ""it's as close as a blade"" because it isn't but that's not why I switched from blade shaving to electric some 7 years ago. I am using an electric shaver because shaving with a blade had my skin irritated, especially on my neck. The 8140XL was okay but my neck still felt uncomfortable. The Architec does NOT irritate my neck at all and this is a very good thing.<br /><br />The above comes with a price. Shaving takes a lot longer. You need to go over the same area several times before all the hairs are 'lifted and cut' but that was a tradeoff I understood and I accepted. Norleco claim that the Arcitec has ""50% more shaving surface"" (compare with the old 8140XL claim of ""up to 50% more shaving surface"") is just marketing hype and always left me ask myself ""50% more than what?"". The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec's are not larger than the 8140XL's but I would not call them 'humongously large"". And, again, contrary to marketing claims, shaving with the Arcitec or with just about any other electric shaver is not 'fast'.<br /><br />As I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model. Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because 'lift and cut' is good but not perfect but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.<br /><br />Trimmer<br />--------<br />A small trimmer can be pulled out when needed. I am not going to use it that much but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache. It's a useful feature.<br /><br />Other bells and whistles<br />-----------------------<br />When needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver's body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement indicator.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE<br /><br />I don't like spending a lot of time taking care of my shaving tools and the Arcitec does not need a lot of maintenance. Each of the 3 individual heads can be opened and the hair fragments stored inside are washed away in seconds. Any that don't go can be removed with the providing brush. It's possible to also use liquid soap or degreasing liquid (alcohol) solutions for cleaning but I haven't yet.<br /><br />The trimmer, if used extensively, could use a couple of drops of mineral oil once or twice per year.<br /><br />Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an 'replace head' indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes but we are not there yet and I will be making that decision when the time comes.<br /><br />SUPPORT AND WARRANTY<br /><br />There is a 45-day money back guarantee. Philips Norelco promise to fully refund your purchase price if you ship them back the product within 45 days of your purchase date. You will be paying for shipping and insurance and they are not responsible for lost items - therefore the need for insurance.<br /><br />In addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver or you try to fix it your self or through unauthorized repairers.<br /><br />The 800 numbers you need to call for support or warranty service are printed on several locations on the box and on the manual.<br /><br />Made in Holland.<br /><br />DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS<br /><br />'The looks' is clearly Arcitec's distinguishing feature. I like it but I'm not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon's page. As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time. The Arcitec's body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving. I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.<br /><br />The charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it's not easy to close/open and it can't store then shaver while the heads cap is on. I didn't take it on the road yet but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don't believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling so I'm not so sure the bulkiness is justified.<br /><br />Finally, I wish there was some 'case' to carry or store everything. The way the shaver comes, it's possibly to store it inside the pod but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are 'outside' and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my 'regular' shaver. Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it. Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time. Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but... that's what our reviews are for.<br /><br />I hesitated between 4 (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars. If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating. I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",False,1,1,1,3

My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and 'even him out' as well.<br /><br />What you get:<br /><br />- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.<br />- The clipping attachment<br />- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades<br />- Large comb<br />- Small comb<br />- Stubble comb<br />- Charger<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- English/Spanish instructions<br />- Registration card with $20 coupon offer<br /><br />Some specs:<br /><br />- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.<br />- Charge time is 10 hours.<br />- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.<br />- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)<br /><br />Returns and warranties:<br /><br />There's a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.<br /><br />The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn't do anything 'unreasonable' and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured. Proof of purchase, of course, is a must.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a 'corded' mode. The comfortable, rubberized grip makes hair cutting, even self-cutting easy and efficient.<br /><br />The brief manual is written in good English and is very good at illustrating cleaning and assembly and has very good advice on maintenance, preserving battery life and even some haircutting tips.<br /><br />Issues:<br /><br />My big problem and the only one so far is the lack of some case or storage box. With so many parts of which some are small and/or fragile, not providing some way to store them, protect them and keeping them organized is inexcusable.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />This would have been an easy 5-star if it came with a case. Since it doesn't, it gets 4.<br /><br />I still recommend the QC5055 most highly but be prepared to supply your own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tools or maybe misplace the essential charger.",False,1,1,1,3

One of them stopped working after a couple of weeks - was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement - and the other stopped after a little over one month. The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.<br /><br />The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.<br /><br />Pros for this toothbrush:<br />- low price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- short life due to almost inevitable water damage<br />- use of 'throw away' batteries<br /><br />My recommendation: avoid.<br /><br />Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare.

Hollyberry Cosmetics, Clinical Strength Hyaluronic + Vitamin C Serum For Dry and Problem Skin - Premium Skin Moisturizer Anti Wrinkle and fine lines. Brighten + Even Blemishes Quick drying, is AWESOME! I truly love most any serums that have Vitamin C in them. I have only been using this serum for about four days and I can already see a difference! My face has cleared up almost completely. It is a clear serum that is not too runny, which I love because there is not such a rush to just &#34;throw' it on your face before it runs down your fingers. This serum soaks in rather quickly, so if you are like me, and have a whole regimen of serums, toners, moisturizers, ect, to put on your face, neck, and chest, following with make up, this is quite important to me. I can also see the brightening part of this serum working for my complexion, evening it out. I am only twenty seven years old, but I did a lot of tanning in high school, so I am trying to make up for the damage I caused to my skin, and its never too early to prepare your skin for aging that will come in the future.

Brighten + Even Blemishes Quick drying works for this as well! The ingredients are perfect in covering quite a few different problems, so its kind of an all in one, type serum, which i love! I am a very impatient person, so I like serums that I can either see or feel a difference rather immediately, than a serum that you have to use for a long time before seeing results, so if you are like me, I definitely recommend this serum!! I have spent all kinds of money on super expensive serums thinking that the more money you spend, the more results you will see, and that is just not the case.<br /><br />Also, when I try a new serum, I do not use any other serums that are similar to this one, so I can get a good idea of what results this serum will really show. I like to add that in because even though I have many serums, if I were to use a similar serum to this one, I like to give it a fair chance!

I like the texture of the cream and the way it absorbs into my skin without leaving any stickiness or scent.<br /><br />I always use moisturizer after washing my face and body that's why my skin is in good condition, apart from under the eye and few lines on my neck. But to keep it that way as I get older, I need to include anti aging products into my daily skin care routine. These two products are packed with natural ingredient like Vitamin E, Avocado, Jojoba, Rosehip, Shea Butter, Coconut oil etc., which are very good for the skin and with continuous use it'll keep the skin young as both of these products are anti aging.  I'm sure with regular use I'll see the results but I have to give time. Over all I'm happy with both the products. When applied, it absorbs well into the skin and leaves my skin very soft and smooth.  Both of these products comes in large 4 oz jar and a little goes a long way.

I believe it's best for costume/cosplay or every once in awhile. A week or 2 at best. I can see it being everyday for some with basic styling, hats/accessories, just not for me.<br /><br />Ya gotta finesse a bit to get styles because the wefts will show & even the cap along the edges--Especially the temples (by the ears). Honestly, I feel the wig is a bit on the small side if you can't get your hair super flat. I couldn't get the wig pulled forward all the way wearing my hair how I normally do under wigs. I can usually grab any wig & it fits, so one that fits awkwardly for me I know is a caution for others who have to choose more carefully.<br /><br />It's about average thickness of decent synthetic wigs. The fluffiness on the bottom makes it seem thicker. It's more 'full' than thick. There's a lot of wefts constructed closely together, so everything is concealed well enough.<br /><br />It does shed a bit as does every blonde synthetic wig I've ever had. It's not necessarily excessive, but I get a bit of shedding everytime I comb it.<br /><br />The part is done decently & can be blended to match your natural scalp.<br /><br />I don't care for the style right out the bag. Although I love the waves, the curl curls too hard for my taste. I don't like the way the back looks at all. I did a quick straighten with my blow dryer, so it can def be done with heat (the photo with my hand in the neck of my shirt).<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty decent synthetic wig. I love the color, but wasn't impressed by the finish on the perimeter & the 2 torn loops at the back for adjusting (I now have to wear it at the tightest adjustment. I can repair by sewing but could be an inconvenience for some). Also, I feel it's kind of below the average size for a wig.<br /><br />With that I'd say it's a bit steep, but maybe makes up for it in uniqueness & style opportunities . . . if you know how.",False,1,1,1,3

This is one of several products that I have tried from Valentia and I have to say, they don't disappoint. I feel like their price point is great and you're getting an amazing product. I have dark circles under my eyes thanks to having two small children and terrible allergies so when a product claims to lighten dark circles I'm always very hesitant. My dark circles are constantly a problem because of my allergies but I did notice a slight difference in color after using this eye cream for a few days which is something that I was definitely shocked by. Another thing that the product claims to do is to reduce wrinkles and fine lines and I definitely can tell that it definitely did that. I am still young but do have some fine lines starting to make an appearance and the True Glow Eye Cream did help with those. It also left my under eye area feeling very moisturized which is HUGE for me as I have very very dry skin.<br /><br />Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream has some really great ingredients in it. It contains Vitamin C, Astaxanthin, Resistem, Organic Roseship Oil, and Arnica which all have wonderful anti-aging properties and help you keep your skin feeling and looking youthful.<br /><br />The product should be applied twice daily, after cleanser.

I was thrilled with the results, and wanted one for myself, but just couldn't see spending so much money on something that I'd rarely use. Imagine my surprise when I found this one online for a fraction of the price!<br /><br />So does it work is probably all that you're concerned about. In one word: YES! I actually put this to the test of &quot;only 8 seconds&quot; to style! I put it at only 200% during my test, which is almost half of the reccomend end temperature for my hair type. I did this to give the product a true test. Sure, it worked excellent at the highest temperature setting, but what snoot those who don't want too much heat damage? Well, I'm happy to report that even at half the heat, and at only 8 seconds, this product worked beautifully! Wow! I simply did slow strokes through each section of my hair and the outcome was beautiful!<br />Now, with the test at full temperature and longer than 8 seconds, well that came out just as great as a flat iron. I found that this unit glided freely through my hair with minimal pulling. I passed the brush through each section slowly 2-3 times each. In the end my hair was shiny, smooth, and full of life!<br />The bristle portion is far safer than a traditional flat iron as well. The cord is extremely thick, and the unit has a nice weight to it. The temperature is easily adjusted by pressing the buttons next to the led display.<br />In conclusion: for a girl with extremely long straight hair, this unit performed beautifully. Sure, it takes a bit more work than a straight iron since heat is only being applied from one side as opposed to two. However, my hair was able to keep its bounce because of it! My hair is always so stiff after a use with an iron, not so with this brush. I highly approve. Sample provided for evaluation.",False,1,1,1,3

When I found out I was receiving these products to review I was sort of nervous. For one thing I have not used an eyelash curler since I was a teen. Second of all, I was really not sure at all about the hair remover. It looked like something that would be used in torture. Now that I have used them, (after my daughter took the initial test run and she turned out okay) I love them!<br /><br />First of all they are pretty tools in pretty boxes! They are so girly and pretty and pink, and red, and I love that! I thought that being pink that my husband would leave them be as he is always using my tools, but nope, he got a splinter woodworking tonight and came out after getting it out of his skin and asked where the pink tweezers came from. I gave him the run down about it and he said they were a lot better than our other tweezers, which for the record were pretty good too!<br /><br />Now I will say, the hair remover can be a bit painful but no more painful than trying to tweeze those delicate areas. It does the job a lot faster too. I have fair skin and light facial hair so unless in the sun you can barely see it but in the sun I look a bit furry, even at my lip line. I have used the hair remover on my upper lip and corners of my mouth and while it didn't feel great, it was not too bad and now I have a smooth lip! I also did my hairline and face. It works after you get the hang of it which didn't take long to do.<br /><br />I was surprised with the lash curler. I remember the curlers from my youth, always sticking on my lashes, pulling them out, but I also do not remember them having the nice slick black stuff on them. I guess we have come a long way in non stick surfaces! I also learned my lashes are naturally longer on my right eye than my left. Interesting, never noticed that before. I can now have lovely curly lashes before applying mascara!<br /><br />Lastly, the tweezers ... nothing can compare to a great tweezer! I hate when the ends do not come together completely, useless. These tweezers are perfect and really get the job done.<br /><br />I like having my &#34;girly&#34; tools now, they are pretty to use, and I know it seems shallow, but when I have to pluck, tweeze, and remove hair from my face, I prefer to do it with something pretty rather than utilitarian!<br /><br />And yes for the record I did get this free but I would never review something I do not personally enjoy using.",False,1,0,1,2

AFU7CN6RDH76FTFRTTHO257YVRVQ,B08L3Z7VVB,3.0,"I have kind of mixed feelings about this soap. I love neem and I love natural essential oil based soaps. The design of this soap was actually really cool and I wasn't expecting it. It has a cool floral print with a lot of neem bark bits (I think so anyway?) that really help with exfoliation. The smell is a bit funky but it also is clear to me that it's only using neem and those essential oils listed, neem is a funky smell. I do feel like the feel was nice and it lathered and cleaned well.<br /><br />However I think for the price the ingredients are kind of junky. You can see that they make a big deal about it having shea butter, etc, but that's way down on the list of ingredients. This is mainly a glycerin based soap with a harsh  surfactant/foaming agent in it, Sodium Stearate, as well as a lot of other ingredients that I haven't seen in a long time in a natural soap bar. I didn't have a bad reaction to it and it doesn't have sulfates but I try to stay away from foaming agents and given the price I don't understand why they are trying to play both sides by acting like this is an ""all natural"" soap when it's a more traditional soap with shea butter, neem, and other stuff added. It's true though that glycerin based soaps can be less harsh on the skin but even the glycerin based soaps I've used don't have all these extra ingredients in them.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again, although my husband had no problem with it - check out Neem Tree Farms for legit neem soap.",False,1,1,0,2

For a long time he has had a shorter travel double edge safety razor from a brand name that's pretty well rated. I suggested that we get him a new razor of this type because he only has the one, which he kept leaving at his family's, and then his beard would grow out for a week! Easier just to get a new one and we were curious to try this non travel one and see if it stacked up.<br /><br />The rose gold color is really pretty in my opinion and really stands out. It doesn't look feminine or anything, just almost like a light copper. It has the same kind of grip banding on the handle that we've seen on other razors but it's really well done. It doesn't look shoddy or imperfect and has a nice hefty feel to it.<br /><br />We didn't want to use the included razors so we can't comment on that but my husband was blown away by how much better this razor was! We're not sure what it is exactly since he doesn't have a lot of experience with different kinds versus the one he's been using for years. He was really surprised how much of a difference it made in being able to shave more quickly like those pros on Youtube.<br /><br />He's still perfecting his shave technique double edged safety razors and we're watching Youtube channels to learn more techniques but the brand apparently makes a huge difference. This is a really surprisingly high quality razor given the quality, brand, and price.<br /><br />The only thing we noticed is that for some reason small hairs would build up under that razor more versus his old one but we're still figuring it out and the ease of use is worth it for now.",False,1,1,0,2

Also, the sponge part has a normal sponge inside, which to me decreases how sanitary this is. You can replace the inside with a silicone sponge that's just used for washing dishes and such and I do have one of these in the shower too when I need more exfoliation.

AGK27I4TT4PMGDEAU2QRLNYCC66Q,B000FEIOHW,5.0,"Since I originally wrote this review, I bought 5 of them, over time.  All are still working.<br /><br />I've used Sonicare since before they were bought out by Philips.  One thing I hated in over 15 years of owning them is the battery dying out, it lasts about 5 years, and I've gone through 3 versions already.  While a new brush will hold a charge for over a week, after 3 years, it will give about 3 days sometimes not, so if you travel with the brush you'll also have to lug the charger, otherwise you'll have a useless brush with no power sometime in your trip.  The brushes still use NiCD, so you get a memory effect and to revive it you have to recharge best when the brush is dead; to do so you have to endure the increasingly weak brush stroking and it dying sometime while you brush.  You can't just leave it on, all Sonicare's have a 2 minute timer, Quad Pacer or not.<br /><br />This AA powered Sonicare I've had for 1.5 years, and it works as good as the rechargeable versions except it doesn't have Quad Pacer, not a problem.  As a brush, it has the vigor and thus, the benefits of what made Sonicare famous.<br /><br />I was concerned about Amazon reviews of water leaking into the battery compartment.  I've tested the brush since then, and found what the weakness is; not cleaning the battery compartment O ring seal after each battery replacement.<br /><br />Like many items used for water, you should clean the battery compartment O ring and its sealing surfaces thoroughly before resealing it.  The head usually has toothpaste on it that is abrasive and gritty and will break the O ring seal if not washed clean out. All a user need do is during a battery change, use an old manual toothbrush to brush clean the open end cap until its clean of all debris.  Wash the O ring with soap and water.  Let both air dry to avoid getting lint on the cap or ring. Use a clean finger to wipe clean the interior battery compartment to insure its clean or clear of residual toothpaste, as this is the other half of the sealing surface that contacts the O ring.<br /><br />When ready to seal, take a tiny dab of vasoline or silicone O ring lubricant between your thumb and forefinger, and pass the O ring through these fingers so it has a light coat of lubricant.  This prevents the o ring from twisting as you insert the cap, and breaking the seal.  Place the o ring on the cap, and push on the Sonicare.  That's it!<br /><br />I use NiMH batteries, and a new set lasts over 2 months, brushing once a day.  I can even use my old used NiMH cells on this brush, and I get about 1 month.<br /><br />The O ring should last over 5 years but if you know O rings, it AS568A size is -023, change them every 2-3 years.  These rings typically cost 1c each, but the problem is finding them, usually they are sold in industrial supply houses.<br /><br />The toothbrush has held up, so it won't die because of leaking or bad battery.  For $25, this unit is an ideal Sonicare. Now if only the brush heads were cheaper.",True,1,0,1,2

AF4RMANOSPVSHXFZ7ELYOUFOWY3A,B07K1DRCYR,1.0,"To begin, I purchase this electric razor because the reviews were good and the price was similar to purchasing replacement HQ9 XL heads for my Norelco electric razor.  I've replaced the heads every year for 11 years and the cutting quality of the heads seem to decrease each year.  So time to try something new.  First thing i notice about this razor is that it is noisier then my Norelco electric razor. Now that has nothing to do with cutting ability but it is a measure of quality. Next, I discovered that you needed to figure out how to remove the protective plastic cover they recommend keeping on the shaver head to protect the blades. For me I kept popping the head until I figured out to remove the cover from the side and not the front where the release button for the head is located.  My Norelco unit does not have a protective cover.  Again, something to deal with but not an issue that would result in me questioning quality. However, after charging the unit for the required 8 hours it was time to give it a try. First notice that it didn't seem to shave any better than my Norelco shaver. In fact after using it for several minutes I did not feel it had cut my beard. Seemed I was feeling the same stubble. I try shaving again and it just didn't seem ti cut any better. In fact I got my Norelco unit out and finished shaving with it. Another thing I notice was that using the new razor did not feel as smooth going over my face as did the Norelco. What I notice was that the Norelco heads sank down into the shaver head which resulted in a large smooth surface for the razor to move across your face.  The new shaver heads sank down the same way but did not result in a large smooth surface area moving across my face like the Norelco.  So at this point I plan to order a new set of HQ9 heads and look into returning the unit.",True,1,0,1,2

AHVP6WWE575B5MCE2C4NFQROI7WQ,B00AX3YNPC,5.0,"After years of shaving, waxing and plucking I have finally found the solution to staying hair free without stubble, bruises or ingrown hairs.<br /><br />I was skeptical of this type of product and assumed that it would be more like an electric shaver and really not be any different in terms of how long my legs would stay smooth.<br /><br />I wish I had tried one years ago. I have sensitive skin and hair regrowing after shaving was causing a great deal of irritation. Because my hair seemed to grow back in a day (maybe I'm part Wolfman) I was shaving every day and because of the blunt ends my skin was itchy and uncomfortable nearly all the time. Underarms were always carrying nicks from razors. Waxing was better because the regrowth didn't cause itching. But it was time consuming, very messy and at times I actually bruised my skin by pulling the strips too quickly.<br /><br />From the first time I used the Braun Epilator I felt this sense of relief that I had finally, finally, finally solved that issue! It does take a few passes to get some of the hairs but it is still less time consuming than waxing. And I have NO irritation afterward at all. Smooth skin that lasts. I do have to use the epilator 2-3 times a week to stay hair-free since hair grows at different rates. You can let all the hair grow out and then epilate to keep from having to repeat use, but I'm fine with using it multiple times a week.<br /><br />I do make sure to moisturize to reduce ingrown hairs as this can be a problem any time the hair is pulled from the roots (as in waxing). Immediately after epilating, I use a cream or oil specifically formulated for use after waxing to minimize any chaffing in the area and keep the skin soft. And I use Tend Skin a day after epilating as I did with waxing which works for me to keep ingrown hairs from forming.<br /><br />The other great thing is that I have already saved money by not having to buy more razor cartridges (very expensive for a good razor) or waxing supplies. And I'm not continually cleaning up wax spots in my bathroom or putting little pieces of tissue on bleeding nicks from razors.<br /><br />The light is a great touch on this epilator. My eyesight isn't what it once was so unless I have bright sunlight it is difficult to see where I may have missed hair. With the light, I can epilate at night with just the bathroom light because the light on the Braun shines directly in the area you are working on.<br /><br />I may have been concerned in the past that this would be too painful to use on a regular basis, but after the bruising, chafing and irritation I was getting with waxing and shaving, it wasn't a concern any longer. I shouldn't have worried about it. I don't consider this to be painful at all. It will probably be a little uncomfortable for someone who hasn't waxed or epilated before, but the sensitivity should go away with use based on the information provided. And you need to be careful using this in areas where your skin is loose. The skin needs to be stretched taut as indicated in the directions for use or you can catch some skin in the epilator. I only had to do this once to remember because that did smart a little.  I have only used the exfoliator head once and it was almost too gentle, but is a nice option to have.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this and you have similar problems with fast hair regrowth and irritation from shaving and waxing, I personally recommend this as a solution.",True,1,0,1,2

I noticed the sponge that I have never used and I have never seen one . The first thing I used is the sponge I had a blending blush full of black eyeshadow and used that to swipe it again to the sponge to see if the dust from eyeshadow would come off so I can reuse it. I think the sponge is if you don't have time to clean your brush and let it dry so you just swipe the shadow off . The eyeshadow did come off but I could still see the black stain on the brush ,however when I used a brown shadow it did not have any blackness in it . I was pretty impressed. Now to the actual sponge , in my head I was like I doubt this will work better than my egg shaped ones ,but It Did and it was so easy the different patterns and shapes they used makes it so where you don't even have to force your hand and scrub hard . I'm not exaggerating either it works so well as you can see in my photo below I didn't even have to rinse the pad to apply more soap and then scrub again. For my other cleaning pads it takes me 3 tries of scrubbing to get my foundation and shadow off . I highly recommend this product it saves time and leaves my brush as if it was never used . Everytime i love a product I see what else the seller has on there page because they might have some more great products.

AFX5UGOK4XANC4BPJYXKPCMGVFKA,B08BNTPZQM,5.0,Ok so I saw all the bad reviews and the score of about 50/50. I lost 95% of my hope. However I've had my 2 big toe nails in grown since I was pregnant with my son 17 years ago. I never get them totally out but I learned to live with it (as much as one could anyways). Lately though they felt like they were getting worse. I had noticed the pain alot more thoroughout the day. A good bit more than I ever had before even. So I decided these probably won't work but what do I have to lose? So I gave them a try. First i got the flimsy clear braces and no matter what i used they wouldn't stick.  So i sent them back for a refund. My suggestion is pass on those kind altogether. Then I bought these. These have the same clear brace inside the bandaid I try to stick them to my nails as is and I'm here to tell ya dont bother it won't work. Then I took 2 dots of super glue and put them on the top and bottom of each side. I pressed them down for a second or 2 and done. It's been at least a week and they're still going strong so that is the way to go people! So moving on now to my unsolicited honest review. The night I put them on I felt an odd pressure in my toe nail immediately that lasted all night. It wasn't painful just unusual to me so it got my attention quite a few times. I was pleased with that because after reading some other reviews I expected pain and soreness from it so that was a pleasant surprise for sure. Come the next day on I havent felt anything. I mean ANYTHING!!!! No pressure from the nail bed changing and/or more importantly NO MORE IN GROWN TOE NAILS!!!! I would have paid 20 times more if I had known these would actually work.

But when wearing it, it's just empty space between the top of the wig cap and the top of your head. And it's not structured at all to help it hold that shape. So I did what any 80's-90's kid would do, and put bump-its on my head, underneath the wig to help fill out that part and give it structure. Also, a headband was necessary to cover up where the bangs meet the rest of the hair, as it was just really weird looking. Then a little teasing and a little aqua net and boom--good to go. I will say also that the wig cap rubbed on my ears uncomfortably, probably compounded by the fact that I had to wear a headband with it.

AHCSOINU2KOXVBOAXKZHGSXZAEFA,B087GD4BJ1,4.0,"This was my first attempt at using magnetic lashes; there's a small learning curve but oh my gosh - SO MUCH EASIER than the old eyelash glue that comes in a separate tube! They're very comfortable; like any false lashes they feel weird at first but after about 15 minutes I forgot they were there & wore them all day with no issues. They stay where you put them, they DO NOT budge until you pull them off. No glue melting or flaking off into my eyes, obviously that's a big benefit! They look super dramatic with pretty minimal effort.<br /><br />I'm a little confused as to why it's best to apply the lashes when the eyeliner is half-dry but still tacky; is there glue built in to the liner as well as magnets? If you need to reposition them, you have to reapply the eyeliner because the lashes pull some of it off. The eyeliner is very wet when you apply, so be careful - you have to shake the tube before application, and when I pulled the brush out, it spewed eyeliner onto the wall (and it was not super easy to remove). So that's the learning curve part, now that I know I'll avoid those pitfalls.<br /><br />The one unavoidable pitfall is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove. I used 3 different types of makeup remover & still needed to scrub my eyelids for a good 10 minutes to get all of it. Not great for the eyelid wrinkle situation! I slathered on a lot of pampering eye cream afterward because my lids were a little sore. I guess I'm glad it won't wear off halfway through the day, but geez!<br /><br />Anyway, despite the difficulty removing it, I'm pretty smitten. I used to love wearing false lashes but they were just so much trouble that I gave it up a few years ago. Now I love them again & they're easy!! I want to order all the lashes!",False,1,1,0,2

Yet this little flat iron somehow makes my abused, frizzed-out hair look smooth, shiny, and healthy! It also feels very soft, with nice movement & body. The photos have not been edited aside from brightening up my bad bathroom lighting, and I did not use any oils, sprays, or other product in my hair after the usual shampoo & conditioner. It took me approximately 6 minutes to style, not including time for the iron to heat up (it’s pretty fast, I just didn’t time it).<br /><br />I dare say it might even work better than the $129 “professional” flat iron I got at a beauty supply store, though my old iron has been with me for 12 years so it definitely has some wear & tear. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering the very reasonable price for this one! The only minor drawback is the awkward control buttons, which are inside the handle & close to the hot plates, though I have not burned myself using them (yet). They’re also a little confusing and I have no idea what the strip of “infrared” lighting inside one plate is supposed to accomplish.

First let me say that I am mostly bed bound and a shower is hard for me and a luxury. So I need all the help I can get in Staying fresh and clean.<br />I got the three pack of the solid sticks thinking of better control and less spilling in my bags. The unscented is the one I was interested in first and the sage and peony next. I got pineapple and  a sage with the unscented in the bundle for $36+.They all smell great.  The unscented did have a slight medicinal smell but not bad. My goal was to smell the proof and not hide it with pretty smells. The first time I used it after my shower:  patted everything dry and applied in all the private areas and even on my neck and under the breasts.  Next morning I did a sniff test and all was good except for arm pits!😫 I also noticed that where my excess skin touches other skin with the product, it tends go stick. It seems to have a antiperspirant affect.<br />2nd time, I did everything the same. And my pits were better.<br />3rd time, finally, all areas were odor free. And yes, I did a 3(the day) no shower to do the test correctly!<br />Perhaps it just took time for my body to properly react to the Lume. I am so pleased and happy at the idea that I can feel a bit more confident if I have to leave bed to meet visitors or end up in the hospital before a proper shower can be had.<br />I like the solid stick as its firm but velvety not overly soft so that it smudges or breaks. Good product. Fair price consider that you don't use as much as with regular deodorant. It also washes off early with soap and water vs del which leaves residue caked on and stains my pits. This does not and my pits look and smell clean.<br />Thank you to the  Lady Dr. Who came up with this product! Girl power!<br />Next I'll try the other two in the set.

Dry your face and apply a moisturizing oil such as coconut oil, jojoba, or argan oil which are particularly nourishing to the skin.<br /><br />Take your now-cool roller and roll over your face, from the center outward. The included instructions suggest to pay particular attention to the area around the nose and under the eyes to aid in the draining and circulation of the lymph glands in those areas.<br /><br />To use the Gua Sha, again, cleanse the face, and moisturize with an oil that is beneficial for the skin.

I confirmed the ID and that there were no spaces, dashes etc. This part ID does not exist on Amazon, making this is an expensive, disposable toothbrush.<br /><br />* * *<br />I've been testing the Panasonic ""Sonic Vibration"" Ionic toothbrush for about a month. What impressed me right away is the size of the unit... much smaller (about 30 percent) than my previous rechargeable toothbrush of another brand.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the ""ionic"" feature, though didn't see it explained in any of the literature that came with the toothbrush. I researched the generic topic of ionic toothbrushes and learned that they emit a flow of positive ions that reverse the surface of the teeth from negative to positive polarity, pulling plaque towards the negatively charged toothbrush head.<br /><br />I haven't been to the dentist yet for my 6-month cleaning but will be eager to see if I get any compliments on the low plaque levels. I'll update this review afterward.<br /><br />In a nutshell...<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Compact size; 30 percent smaller than the other 2 rechargeable toothbrushes I've used in the past few years<br />* Case is great for travel<br />* Ionic feature (in theory) removes more plaque<br />* Timer feature helps you learn the proper pace from start to finish<br />* Easy to use; elegantly designed<br />* The 4-brushing modes ensures the right speed for the desired effect<br />* Included gum-care brushes<br />* Brush is going strong after 1 month - no signs of it needing to be replaced<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Designed (in my opinion) for one person - not really family friendly as claimed.

With the newly conditioned hair, I could separate the tangles without pain. Is my hair unusually soft with this conditioner? No, but it sure strengthened my hair and it seems so thick now!

AEG7ZYNIXB5WKB7YXNU6BBNUAS4A,B00NL5JW6E,4.0,"Overall I do like the PureRadiance Skin Cleansing system - it's easy to use and will work well for almost all skin types, however there are more affordable options out there, this one I think is a bit on the pricey side.  The system comes with 2 cleansing heads: a 'normal' one for every day use and an 'exfoliating' one for weekly use.  There are additional heads you can purchase separately, even one for sensitive skin although I find that the normal everyday one that comes with the system is incredibly soft and gentle.  The system also comes with small plastic cover cases for the heads, a small charging base, power cord to charge the unit, and a small zippered case that holds only the unit itself.  I was a little disappointed that they only included a small zippered pouch that only has room for the unit itself, but no room for the different heads, base or power cord.  If you wanted to travel with this system you would need to put it all into a different (larger) bag.<br /><br />The system is super easy to use - the heads snap on easily and remove just as easily.  Once charged you are good to go, and the system is waterproof (but the charging base is not!), so you can even take it in the shower with you.  You can use with or without your favorite facial cleanser, that's your option.  A built-in 1 minute timer with a reminder 'pulse' every 20 seconds helps ensure that you spend equal amounts of time on all parts of your face and that you don't use the system for longer than you should. There are 2 speeds available - slow, and a little bit faster.  It is very quiet, much quieter than my electric toothbrush.  After 1 minute the system turns off, although you can easily turn it on again if you wish to clean your skin even more.<br /><br />I find the base that the unit sits in inadequately sized given the size of the wand.  The wand is a bit long and heavy, and when you set it down in the small and light plastic base it can easily tip over if not propped near something as tall as it is (for example I keep mine in the corner of my counter where 2 corner walls help keep it from tipping).  While it is nice that the base doesn't take up much room, it seems like it needs to be a little more substantial to hold the wand while charging or drying.<br /><br />I've been using this for a few weeks and it's done a wonderful job of helping remove dry, dull dead skin that is a result of the harsh winter air and is leaving my skin softer and smoother.  Using it once a day seems to work well for me, but different options may work better for others - everyone has a different skin type.

I actually LIKE that ingredients are straightforward and not full of fluff:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Caffeine, Malonic Acid, Zinc Carbonate, Arginine, Laureth-9, Copper Carbonate Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin<br /><br />To be honest--if you're looking to reduce eye puffiness and dark circles, this won't do much.  If found no visible evidence of that in my use. BUT--it's really good at minimizing fine lines, plumping up the skin, and returning elasticity to the skin. That's why it's called ""Elasti-derm"", to help coax the skin into being more hydrated, refined, and pliant, thus reducing the signs of lines. Obagi's main active to do that is malonic acid, and I give a big thumbs up to the addition of arginine-- a powerful delivery vehicle to help drive the malonic acid further into the skin for more efficacy. As many in the skincare industry know, anything with arginine helps make the active ingredient even more ""active"".<br /><br />The stainless steel ball is not just a ""feel good"" gimmick -- it actually helps to massage this serum into the delicate eye skin, further pushing the ingredients into the dermis.

It actually took me a while thinking if I really wanted to use it or not. When I used it for the first time it was more painful than any other times after, so it does gets better, but you have to understand that your body has very sensitive places no matter how many times you epilate! So it comes with two different heads one for shaving/trimming and the other one for epilating, this option lets you change caps. A roller cap is to ""massage"" your skin while epilating so you don't feel much pain (I find it a little poky at times!), the other cap is for a closer epilating now I don't like to use this one in the shower because it doesn't slide as easy. It has a little light that does wonders! It helps you to see those few hairs that are stubborn and you missed. Now... some of the hair it only gets broken, but I think it depends on what direction the hair is and in what direction you are trying to epilate. I usually move my epilator in different directions and angles and it does the trick. I find that the knees area is the most sensitive, so no matter what it will hurt a little. Under my arms I always ask my husband to tighten my skin so the hair gets pull out and not broken. (by the way you HAVE to tighten your skin to get a better epilating).<br /><br />Epilating is not going to give you that smooth feeling like after shaving that only lasts a few minutes anyway! Another fact is you WILL NOT go 4 weeks without epilating! That's not true! At least not for me!You will start to see hair after a week or two, but this are the hairs that break and are not pull so it will only be a few, very unnoticeable in my opinion. But the hair will grow thinner, so I usually epilate  every two weeks, plus my hair grows faster because I take skin supplements and this makes it grow faster.<br />Battery wise... it lasts about 40 minutes enough time to shave for me anyway!<br /><br />In conclusion... one of my best investments!

AHPAL4R5BVR4WEX7UWL5CL5FL7MA,B0BM4GX6TT,5.0,"I'm so glad I found this product! It is easy for me to tint my blond eyebrows a darker color in less than 3 minutes. I was previously paying an aesthetician to tint my eyebrows every couple of weeks but she was charging me $15 each time and it was always a hassle to go in so frequently. But without any color on my eyebrows, I have to pencil them in or I look like I don't have any eyebrows at all because they are such a light color. Also, penciling them in or using an eyebrow powder never seems to look realistic so I really prefer to have them dyed. It is amazing what having darker eyebrows can do for your entire face! I feel like I need less makeup and still look pretty good when I go out as long as my eyebrows look okay.<br /><br />To use this, you simply open the capsule and put the powder in a small dish or bowl. Then use a capful of the included developer and mix it together. Once you've made a cream out of it, you can apply it to your eyebrows. I am very careful to just apply this cream to the part of my eyebrows I want to tint, not my skin or hair below. It can really stain your skin and you'll have to scrub it off for awhile to get it off, so I recommend being careful. After a few minutes have passed, I take a paper towel, fold it in a square, wet it, and put some soap on it, and wipe the dye off my eyebrows. They are instantly darker! I started out using the medium brown color but I think the dark brown color gives a more dramatic eyebrow look and still looks natural. I have blond hair and still think the dark brown looks perfect to frame my face. If you are worried about it being too dark, the best thing to do would be to put on the dye for one minute, wipe it off and check the color. Then if it is not dark enough, use a little more and keep it on for a minute or two until it is dark enough. This product is pretty foolproof and once you get the hang of it, you should have no trouble at all. It saves me $$$ from paying an aesthetician every 2 weeks!<br /><br />The color lasts only for a week to 2 weeks on me-- I don't think that is a problem with the product itself, but is due to the fact that eyebrows are shorter than normal hair and are constantly growing and falling out.

The drawback is that like many other conditioner bars, it is really hard to get enough to put in my hair without being in the shower for too long. I live in a High drought area so I do not want to take long showers messing around with my conditioner bar. A workaround has been to slightly shave  the top layer of the bar off with my fingernail and then rub the shavings in between my hands to create a lotion. I would love to see a way to be able to convert the bar of soap to a more liquid form in an easier way. For now I still have it in my shower, but I’ve gone back to using conditioner in a plastic bottle. I really appreciate the product.",True,1,1,1,3

The box is also huge when you get it and the whole curler is pretty long - definitely not for easy storage. When I used it though, the results turned out GREAT. Basically you work it by clamping the very end of a streak of hair, then pressing one of the arrow buttons to tell the barrel which direction to rotate. It rotates, picking up your hair as it goes. After a few seconds, just let go of the clamp and you have a curl! Brush it through and you'll get the results in the photo. There really wasn't any kind of kink in the end of my hair either as sometimes happens with clamps (as long as you don't rotate the barrel the wrong way from how you clamped it). One nice thing is that there’s a “home” button for when you rotate the barrel too far from where your thumb is to unclamp the strand - you can see it in the video where it kind of rotates back real quick to line up the clamp release with my thumb.

I've broken one already trying to straighten the wire after I bent it.<br />4) The process is NOT instantaneous... after treatment the hair will still feel firmly attached.  Give it an hour or two for the chemical reaction you created to break down the follicle.<br />5) The process will almost certainly only kill &#34;many&#34; of the hair producing cells in the follicle, but not &#34;all&#34;.

AGW3622GYGMYPCR24FT3QW3HFLLQ,B00011JN5G,4.0,"I was nervous about getting this. There are SO MANY models and brands and reviews out there that I finally decided on one that was within my price range to try, but also had decent reviews. I've had this now for about 4 months and have not had any re-growth of the hairs I've taken out. That's what I was looking for - lasting results. That being said, it is tricky to get used to doing this. It's best if you have someone doing it for you. There are a couple of things to keep in mind: 1. You go one hair at a time, and each one took me about 3-4 minutes, and the instructions say not to do more than a square inch of skin at a time. So depending on how much of an area you want to do, and how dense the hair is it may take months and months to clear a significant area, and that's if you do it every other day. 2.) You will have unsightly sores. You are penetrating your epidermis and electrocuting the hair follicle, so you will get a scab on each pore you zap. I used the Tea Tree lotion they recommend on Amazon and it seemed to work fine. I don't know if it would have been the same without the oil. My scabs were there the same amount of time any other scab I've had has been on me - about a week.<br /><br />So it's slow going and leaves scabs, but once the scabs went away my hair has not come back at all. It's been great that way! I'm really glad I bought it. The reasons I didn't give five stars is because it said, &#34;Clean and Easy&#34;. It's not easy, and when something leaves you scabbed over, that doesn't scream &#34;clean&#34; to me. The other reason is because I had to zap each follicle twice on the highest setting before it worked. But I gave it four stars because it did work! So for the price, and once you get used to it, and if you have a way to hide the scabs for a week, then it's great. I'm happy with the results, which for me is the bottom line.",True,1,0,1,2

This is designed for the Asian Mass Market where extremely pale skin is idealized.  It's nothing like what we're used to, color wise.

AE6MVWDBYU4CMPC2DZ5H4ZMSNQFQ,B0185HKE32,5.0,"For the low price, this is a great palette.  Especially because of the fact that every color on the palette is MATTE and that's almost impossible to find.  And the quality isn't low at all, it's nice stuff.  I have the one that is mostly shades of brown and it makes a really nice nude eye, or I can use the darker colors and smoke it up.  There will be a little bit of fallout during application but not enough that it's a problem.  The pans are good size and you get a lot of product.  It is slightly creamy feeling and therefore blends out really well.  If I use a good primer, I don't have to touch up at all in a 6-8 hour period.  The case is just plain black plastic with a little latch closure that is secure, and it's pretty sturdy.  I think it's a tad too big to carry around in my bag anyway, so it doesn't leave my vanity.  I DROPPED this on the tile floor and it didn't break and none of the powders cracked or broke up either.  I find my self going to it quite often when I just want to do some makeup and not spend all day on it.  Every color I want is present and it's easy to apply.  Really a nice palette for the money.

AG673IJ6NMLAWIN7EWCRCXPJGQHQ,B085BB7B1M,5.0,"I received these Beauty skin bath wash cloth/towels in on time and without any damage. I just happened to stumble onto these gems. I ordered the three pack so I could give one to my husband and sister. My husband was like, What - you want me to do What? I am pretty sure he maybe<br />over it for good already though he has used three times but that was because I made him so he could help me with this review. Again he was like<br />What? Ok I really think he is all over it now. I will wash it up now and keep it for me, why? Because I love it!!!!! Yes in deed this is a keeper and I implore you to buy these because you will also love them.<br />I am not sure if you get to pick what color you get when you order only one but when you order the three pack you get one of each color. NO, the colors do not mean anything other than they are a particular color that is all.<br />What I do when I use these wash cloths is I get in the shower and stand as long as I can in  the hot water and changing from front to back. You can also take a hot bath but I am a shower kind of girl so that was the option I used. Once your skin is nice and hot take your wash cloth and put some soap on your cloth keeping in mind when you do that you will not need to use as much because this cloth lathers up A LOT.  Now for this part and I am sure you are wonder why this cloth is so long well you are now going to find out. With one had grab one end of the cloth and with the other hand take the other end of the cloth use it like you were shining you shoes. The harder you do this the better the results. It will make your skin really soft. Now some of the reviews have said that even though they thought they were clean that while using this really big wash cloth that lots of dead skin came off, and they said it was gross because it left a really dirty tub. Maybe I didn't get and dead skin off because I took a shower instead of a bath I don't now without taking a bath, but my skin was really soft. From some of the reviews they said to make sure that the wash cloths you get come from Japan and not from China because they said those were not any good. I don't know that for sure but I thought I should at least warn you what others are saying just in case they are right. I was mine every couple days because I rinse and wash with soap in the shower. I also I rewash myself to make sure all those dirty cells are off me. These should last for a while and can be used until they get soft and are not scratchy anymore.<br />I bought these with my own money no discount for me, I love them and so will you.

AEOFJ7PTDAUCHOLHA7F57RM7YG5Q,B0149YNDP6,4.0,"The only thing important on this product is the active ingredient chlorexidine. The standard concentration is 2%. Hibiclens is an &#34;overkill&#34; at 4%. Regardless, here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES on this chemical agent.<br />.<br />.<br />ADVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is the ideal antiseptic skin cleanser - the &#34;gold standard&#34; in the opinion of numerous medical people. According to all available literature on the internet, a 2% solution kills a broad spectrum of micro-bacteria on contact. The chemical has a positive charge and binds to bacteria that is negatively charged. This electrical action weakens and disintegrates the bacterial cell membrane wall, thus destroying the organism. Because human and animal tissues are also negatively charge, the agent binds to the skin for the next five to six hours. As a result, the affected area inhibits bacterial growth.<br />. . . The antiseptic properties only affect organisms on the skin. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY's &#34;Penetration of Chlorhexidine into Human Skin&#34; reported &#34;poor penetration of chlorhexidine into skin following 2 min. and 30 min. exposures to chlorhexidine was observed.&#34; In other words, the agent is relatively safe because it does not penetrate the skin and get absorbed into human tissue or the blood stream and cause damage or toxic chemical reactions.<br />.<br />2. Its effective antiseptic action was demonstrated in one medical study with chronically ill children. Daily bathing with the stuff reduced bacterial growth by 35%.<br />.<br />In most hospitals, physicians scrub their hands with this agent before surgery. Also, patients must wash with this agent on the evening and morning before their operations.<br />.<br />3. A 2% solution is the recommended concentration to be used for surgical scrubbing according to EPIC and CDC guidelines. This maybe an overkill for consumer usage. As a skin cleanser, THE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS NURSING reported that anything over a 0.5% concentration showed &#34;no significant differences statistically, including persistent effects within 24 hours.&#34; A lower strength of 0.2% was just as effective according to INT. ENDED J. 2001. The only difference is speed. A 0.2% concentration takes 1 min. to completely kill E. Faccalis while a 2% concentration takes 30 sec.<br />. . . The ineffective limit is a 0.12% concentration. This does not kill E. Faccalis. The above findings were replicated and confirmed by a more recent U.S. study in J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb.<br />. . . For oral rinsing, it is a different matter because the mouth is not covered by skin but mucus membrane. It is also host to different germs. The standard treatment is a 0.12% chlorhexidine concentration. However, optimum effects require a higher concentration. Clinical trials reported by THE JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY said that a 1% concentration &#34;showed a significant reduction through intensive treatment (3-4 daily applications over 2 days) or through daily application for 10 and 14 days.&#34;<br />.<br />4. Because a 0.2% concentration is just as effective as &#34;straight out of the bottle,&#34; a 2% chlorhexidine can be diluted with water to yield ten times the amount of usable disinfectant. Also, a 4% Hibiclens concentration can yield 20 times the amount.<br />.<br />5. Hibiclens is overpriced. The cheapest on amazon.com is $56.74 plus $6.40 for shipping, $63.14 is very expensive. . . . It is worse at the local drug stores. The average price is $12 per 8 oz. That is $192 for a gallon of the stuff.<br />.<br />A cheaper alternative is to buy a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate from a pet products vendor. The cheapest is sold by Greener Pastures Veterinary Service Store for $8.25/gallon. If the user purchases $100+, there is free 2-day shipping.<br />.<br />6. Among most chlorhexidine literature from manufacturers, they recommend one to two ounces to a gallon of cleaning solution for sanitizing floors, counter-tops, and furniture. In addition, anecdotal testimonies from pet owners, stores, and clinics report a reduction in sicknesses among animals when the solution is used to clean their cages, skin, and gums.<br />. . . This is surprising. One ounce of chlorhexidine to a gallon of water amounts to a 0.03125% solution. According to a study by the J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb., E. Faccalis bacteria was smeared on glass cones. A 0.12% chlorhexidine concentrate failed to kill the strain. It required a 0.2% or higher to do the job.<br />. . . Based on these facts, the only possible conclusion is that the weaker concentration does not directly kill existing bacteria but creates a hostile environment for germ growth. The chemical inhibits the spread of dangerous organisms on the skin, mouth, and inorganic surfaces. Through time, the noxious population is further reduced. Thus, it becomes less dangerous to the host.<br />.<br />7. J. ACQUIR. IMMUNE. DEFIC. SYNDR. 2004 Feb. 1 reported that a 0.25% concentration is well tolerated by women, even in the sensitive vaginal area. At 1% concentration, there were 13% complaints of burning and itching.<br />.<br />.<br />DISAVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The product has risk. It is well documented that exposure to the eye and mid-ear causes ulceration damages.<br />.<br />2. According to federal records, there were 403 reported cases of adverse reactions to chlorhexidine gluconate. As expected, a majority was negative skin reaction: irritation and redness. Washing the affected area with soap and water will negate the problems within 72 hours.<br />.<br />.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />.<br />.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS<br />.<br />Based on two medical studies, a water dilution of chlorhexidine to a 0.2% concentration is the minimum for eliminating microbial organisms. Leave it on for a 1 minute. As an added bonus, the 0.2% concentration is well tolerated, even in the vaginal area of females. . . . If you want a quick guaranteed kill, use a 0.5% concentration.<br />.<br />For inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria on counter-tops, floors, pet cages, and animals, one-to-two ounces of 2% chlorhexidine to a gallon of water &#34;will do the job.&#34; Again, this only reduces the germ population by restrict",False,1,1,1,3
AFCPXTD7E6EN6CM673WH27OADCPQ,B01N8SLDVB,5.0,"I bought this set about 5 months ago. A friend and I did this treatment to eavhother’s Hair once in October and again in December. We both had fabulous results but learned a few things:<br />My experience:<br />I have wavyish hair that has been colored every 10 weeks or so for the past 15 years. It’s shoulder length and fine strands but I have a lot of hair.<br />The first application was applied as directed and I used my CHI flat iron (only gets to 392 degrees according to advertising) and I left the treatment in for 2 overnights. The process took about 3.5 hours for both of us with one ty of distractions and interruptions from our kids. While the product was still in my hair, each day I would re-straighten my hair. When I washed it the first time, it was like heaven. The results were phenomenal and my morning hair-routine went from 30-45 minutes down to about 5, no exaggeration. My hair dried quickly and perfectly straight and I used the flat iron for a few touch-ups around my face. I made the mistake of assuming the shampoo and conditioner I was using st this time was sulfate-free... I was wrong 😒. The results were great for about 3 weeks then I realized my error and couldn’t wait to get together with my girlfriend again to re-do. In December I did the second treatment the same way and this time I washed my hair the following day. The results were just as good as leaving it in for 2 nights so I don’t think the length of time you wait before washing has anything to do with effectiveness. However, by ‘washing’ I mean I rinsed the stuff out of my hair thoroughly and then applied the mask and rinsed that and styled - so it wasn’t really washing I guess. Following this second treatment I used CHI Keratin shampoo and conditioner and applied the treatment mask that comes with this set about 1x week  and the results have lasted about 7+ weeks. The aftercare products are VERY important in my experience! I just did a Keratin treatment at home yesterday (using a different brand just to compare/contrast) and I’m anxious to see if the results are the same.<br />My Friend’s experience:<br />She has shoulder-length hair that is occasionally colored. Her hair is thick and courser than mine with a very, very slight wave - just enough to require a flat iron to look polished.<br />Following the treatment she couldn’t stand the feeling of the stuff in her hair so she rinsed it out and used the mask within a few hours of completing the process. She had heavenly results for the first 3 weeks then noticed a decline and realized she, too, had been using the wrong kind of shampoo and conditioner. After the second treatment (which she also washed out immediately) she used a Keratin shampoo and conditioner and used clarifying shampoo an couple times a week and has had consistently amazing results even currently.<br /><br />We each had 2 treatments (4 applications total) and there’s still enough left in this bottle for another treatment, maybe 2.<br />I think this product is an amazing value and will almost certainly buy again.<br /><br />Added bonus, the treatment mask and clarifying shampoo smell really amazing!<br /><br />I purchased this product with my own money after hours of research and comparing products - no freebies here (although I’m not opposed to receiving them ~ hint-hint 😏)",True,1,0,1,2

They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good.

These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off. One last thing, my skin is sensitive but they haven’t really bothered me so that is a big plus.",False,1,1,1,3

Also includes a close over flap to protect the brush heads.<br />Face brushes : keeping in mind that this is a budget set, I didn't not compare these to my Sigma or real techniques brushes. Instead I looked at their overall quality and performance. The face brushes are soft, decent on the amount of hairs and pretty dense. They worked well for everything I tried, although I do not use powder foundation. A few of the brushes had some uneven hairs poking out, which I trimmed and did not seem to negatively affect the outcome. Ferrules on my set (white and gold) are firmly attached, no wobbly-ness and no shedding after washing twice and using twice.<br />Eye brushes: work pretty well, I like the face brushes better to be honest but these work, just not great. My issue was with the product pick up and then depositing it on my eyelids... It did but not evenly. The ferrules were attached firmly and not shedding on theses either. Only one eye brush had a few uneven hairs.<br />Package also included a brief description of brush names and suggested uses, along with cleaning instructions (useful for a beginner, for sure).<br />Overall, the set is pretty good and the price is really good.

The bottle actually comes with a twist-off regular cap, and you have to screw on the (included) spray atomizer, with the purple tassle. The bottle itself is pretty basic, simple design, but the atomizer dresses it up a little bit.  Anyhoo, this fragrance is lovely. Again, I did not know who LM is, and had I known, I might've passed this by, thinking it would be geared toward the young crowd (especially seeing the review calling this a cotton candy scent..more on that later..). But as a woman of 47 years of age, I think this is for any age, really. Yes, there is a sweetness, but not a sugar-bomb nor &#34;hi I am a frosted cupcake!!&#34; scent.  Just a soft sweetness. Hint of floral. I pick up a wee bit of lavender, and a soft floral note in general, in addition to the soft sweetness. Has a comforting, relaxing vibe to this. I am not picking up cotton candy at all, but to each their own. I  know Laura Marano had 2 other scents in very similar bottles, so I am wondering if the reviewer got confused..? Or maybe the reviewer does pick up a cotton candy scent, different noses and different skins can translate fragrances in different ways.<br /><br />Longevity for this one is surprisingly very decent, I get a good 12+ hours, yet this is a soft projection, not heavy nor overpowering.  The scent stays a soft sweetness with a hint of floral (and still that wee touch of lavender that I pick up), all throughout the day, so it is nice to have a fragrance that does not change notes wildly throughout the day. I love this for laid-back, relaxing days. For the money, such a very affordable price, this is a tremendous fragrance and value. I honestly would never guess this to be a celeb scent or such an affordable scent, it is lovely. Not cloying at all and no heavy alcohol/chemical scent to this. Just a lovely soft sweet floral.<br /><br />And even though lavender is not listed as a note, I swear to goodness I pick up a touch of lavender. But then someone picks up a cotton candy note. Different scents to different noses, I guess!! Nicely done. I tend to shy away from celeb scents, but I honestly can't find any fault with this one. Just lovely.",False,1,1,1,3

Long used in certain systems of traditional medicine (including African and Asian traditional medicine), tamanu oil is applied directly to the skin.<br /><br />This tamanu oil is manufactured by Gio Naturals, and is 100% PURE ORGANIC COLD PRESSED & UNREFINED!  The oil comes in a 4 ounce amber colored bottle with treatment pump.  It is USDA & ECO Certified Organic.  Tamanu oil is renowned for it's skin regenerating and healing properties.  Since the oil is proven to have solid antibacterial, astringent and anti inflammatory qualities, you really can't go wrong by adding it to your facial care routine.  I make a night time facial serum from Grape Seed Oil, Tamanu Oil, Argan Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Lemongrass essential oil, Tea Tree oil and Vitamin E oil.  Tamanu oil absorbs quickly, even though the oil is thick (and dark green). It does have a strong nutty / earthy scent but the lemongrass in my recipe kind of masks it, plus you get used to the scent with continued use.  It is pretty strong if you use it as a stand alone oil, but again it is highly effective so you need to balance the pros (many) and cons (scent) to decide if it is right for you.  Personally it is my go to oil for facial products.<br /><br />Tamanu oil is touted as a natural remedy for the following conditions:  acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, and sunburn.  Since tamanu oil is said to alleviate pain, the oil is also used topically to relieve the pain caused by conditions like sciatica, shingles, and rheumatism. Some proponents also claim that tamanu oil can help aid in the regeneration of skin. For this reason, tamanu oil is thought to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars. In addition, tamanu oil is said to promote the healing of burns, blisters, cuts, and scrapes.  It is a great, all-purpose therapeutic oil.  Works well for my sensitive, acne prone skin.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount. I have provided an honest and unbiased review based on my personal experience with this product.

AHXY35GXBNSFLLBD3VXX75TI4MDA,B000PKKAGO,5.0,"Somehow, calling the Norelco arcitec 1090  a ""Men's Shaving System"" seems to be a little pretentious; so I'll still call it a shaver... a very, very good shaver!<br /><br />I got the aritec with the idea that it just might be time to adjust my look and rid myself of the beard I'd sported for the past two and a half years (long story, dull, boring and not germane to a product review).  I played with it and the beard for a week or so and then got real with the scissors and trimmer one evening.  Wow!  This is great!<br /><br />This represents my fourth (or fifth?) Norelco shaver over the past 40-odd years, so clearly I'm guilty of some serious brand loyalty.  But while my previous Norelco shavers each represented a modest improvement over each predecessor, the arcitec is so far advanced that I'm really amazed.  It's cordless (uh.. duh...), but the first appealing little techno-googah in its arsenal is a display that tells you how many minutes worth of charge remain.  Nice touch!  Another informational readout tells you when to clean the stubble from the unit, nice for absent-minded souls like me that can get in a rush some mornings and are left wondering days later why the razor sounds a little ""off"".<br /><br />I'm kind of a ""good design"" junkie.  I can't innovate myself, but I'd like to think that I recognize when the designers really, really sat down and looked for ways to make their product better.  The arcitec delivers on that big time!<br /><br />Cleaning the shaving head ensemble is absurdly easy.  The heads just flip up so that you can blow, brush or rinse them out.  Yes, I said rinse, as in the use of running water.  This isn't the first razor that claims to be water friendly, however it is the first one to give me enough confidence to actually hold the shaving head under the tap.  The only criticism that I have is that the trimmer almost seems like something of an afterthought.  It's fine for trimming sideburns, however when I had the beard it was a little clunky to use while trimming around the edges etc.  But with my newly clean-shaven approach, that's a very minor complaint.<br /><br />In the end however, all of those lovely little features like numeric display of the remaining battery charge, maintenance and cleaning access, and other things would all fall by the wayside if the quality of the shave were substandard.  So I will simply state that the arcitec leaves me with a smoother face than any other shaving system I've ever used... electric shaver or razor blade!<br /><br />Nothing ticks me off more than paying a premium price for a product that doesn't deliver premium performance.

The charger is just a cable that plugs into the bottom. I personally hate bases as I have drawers and other storage and this allows me to pull it out real quick to charge the couple of hours it needs and then I just bundle it up and put it away.<br />2. The Battery lasts a long time, even with the vacuum this thing just keeps going. Should easily last me a month as I have goatee and mustache versus a full beard.<br />3. The vacuum does a good job and picks up most hairs so there is minimal cleanup. Usually I just blow on the head to get rid of loose hairs so they don't end up in my drawer.<br />4. The size adjustment is quick and doesn't require separate attachments.<br />5. It gives you a great look, it gives a nice even cut and I will be using this for a few years.<br /><br />Negatives<br />1. If your trimmer batteries are dead it still won't run even when plugged in. The trimmer turns off the charging port when you press the on button. The more expensive model allows this so it's just a up sell not a technical limitation.<br />2. This device is huge compared to most other trimmers I have tried. For the most part this isn't too bad but it's sort of difficult to trim my mustache under my nose but with a little practice it isn't hard.<br />3. It can get clogged when doing longer hair as the vacuum is smaller so either cut long hair in two steps or just keep cutting because it still cuts just fine even when the vacuum is clogged..<br /><br />Overall I compared this to the higher end model that has the smaller trimmer attachment and I would say get this plus a tiny Remington trimmer as I feel these are too fat for delicate work.<br /><br />UPDATE: I purchased this item June 2009 and gave it a full charge. I trim my mustache and goatee regularly with this and I have not charged it since new and it performs perfectly.

IF Norelco had decided to incorporate a Travel Case into this Clamshell packaging with re-usable features, then I would have been content. But as it was, this was just a waste of plastic. Clamshell packages have sent numerous folks to the hospital with some nasty cuts inflicted while trying to open this sealed, thick plastic, stubborn packaging. Then again, it is a waste of plastics made even more wasteful when you consider the price of petroleum nowadays, and the inability to recycle this type of plastic. I suppose someone who wants to, can, with a little ingenuity and transparent mailing tape, take this Clamshell Package and create a travel container for their 8040x-- which might be a good idea, because the fabric travel pouch that Norelco supplies with this shaver only holds the shaver, and not the accessories -- unless you want to cram everything into the travel case and NOT close it.<br /><br />Well.... now -- about the shaver itself. The instruction book is very thorough -- but the warnings interspersed throughout are in grey print -- how about bold black?<br /><br />The shaver itself is nothing I would want to use all the time -- in fact, after trying it, I still prefer my 550 TL. The heads on the 8040X DO flex, but the moisturizing cream/gel only comes through two of them when all three heads with moisturizer would work much better -- the heads also drag across my skin -- and in some instances gave me a bit of razor burn -- especially on my neck. This shaver was used in the shower, so there was plenty of (acqua) moisture, in addition to gel moisturizer, available for a close shave, but the shave was not as good as it should have been.<br /><br />Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full. Um.........<br /><br />This Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it's gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning.

Additionally, the entire case was permanently wrinkled - as if a truck was parked on it for days.  The loops where the insulin vials go were too large & didn't hold the vials securely.  It is quite obvious that the photos of the product were taken before the manufacturer had the product made by a cheaper company.<br />As if that weren't bad enough, when I contacted Medicool for a Return Authorization, they directed me to contact the manufacturer to tell them what I didn't like about the product.  When I did contact them, I was connected to an idiot who tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong with the product & I just &#34;changed my mind.&#34;  After I contacted Medicool again & said, &#34;Either give me a refund or I'll dispute the charge with my Credit Card Company,&#34;  they sent me a return label.<br />I suggest you don't do business with a company that doesn't stand behind their products, especially when their products are JUNK.",False,1,0,1,2

And while I wear a beard now, I still have to shape the hairline up around my lower neck and face.<br /><br />If you're prone to razor rash or ingrown hairs, this is a much better pick for you than any other disposable razor.  Originally designed by a black dermatologist, this razor was created specifically for black guys that have a chronic problem with daily shaving.  Well, as guys go, they're not alone.  And this razor fixed that problem for me handily!<br /><br />Back when I wore a suit and tie, and worked minimally six days a week, daily shaving became a real bummer for me.  This razor offered an affordable and convenient &#34;fix&#34; for a real problem.<br /><br />How It Works:  A thin &#34;rake&#34; overrides the single blade, preventing the cutting edge from shaving too closely, thereby eliminating the aforementioned problems of razor rash and ingrown hairs.  No, you won't get as close a shave...  But a five o'clock shadow at two o'clock, is a lesser evil than a face or neck full of razor rash and ingrown hairs!  Some people's hair/follicles and skin-types will simply not tolerate an ultra-close shave, and that's the end of it.<br /><br />Note:  Anybody that is troubled with razor-related problems, should avoid using the double and triple blade cartridges, as these will just exacerbate your problems.  Further, guys (or gals) with such problems should avoid shaving against the direction of the hairs as well, as this too will just exacerbate your problems.<br /><br />Also:  There are better solutions for shaving than shaving soap.  Hair conditioner, warmed slightly in a microwave cup shaves far nicer than any soap I've tried in 62 years.  And it's good to let the conditioner sit on your skin a few minutes before shaving.  Just keep your razor rinsed-out really well, while using it.  Clogged razors can be cleared with an old toothbrush, always brushing away from the blade's cutting edge to avoid damaging it.<br /><br />Depending on your beard, a single Bump Fighter Razor can serve well between say, three days and one week...  Some guys alternate these razors with the more traditional types...  After a while, I found that I really only needed these Bump Fighter Razors on my neck, where my collars rubbed.<br /><br />Note:  My wife favored these razors for her personal grooming as well, reporting zero rash or ingrown hair issues when using them.  She later found that she could make do with regular disposable razors on her legs and underarms, but greatly preferred these Bump Fighter Razors for bikini-line work, and such.  You'll figure it out...<br /><br />I was very pleased to see Amazon pick up these razors, since Wal-Mart and Walgreens stopped carrying them in stores.  I had to go looking for them online, and while I did find them, it's so much easier just adding them to my Amazon orders!<br /><br />Note:  People with severe shaving-related issues should look into permanent hair removal via laser or pulsed light depilation by a professional.  The winter rates are getting more and more affordable, I hear, and it offers at least a &#34;semi-permanent&#34; solution.<br /><br />RayB",True,1,0,1,2

AER4U3RNYYCPUPGVKXYATZ2QD7TA,B07STZPR5W,4.0,"For the price, I'm genuinely surprised with this nail drill. First of all, it doesn't suffer from the two major issues most cheap nail drills face: lack of torque and internal wobbling. A lack of torque is when the rotation mechanism stalls out if you press hard enough against the nail. You'll know a nail drill has internal wobbling because it will almost tickle or feel uncomfortable when you file your nails.<br /><br />With that being said, here's what I don't like: I prefer much thinner nail drills. Even if you ""choke up"" your grip onto the thinner part of the drill it's still thick enough to make my hands tired if I'm using it for longer than a few minutes. I can't imagine this being comfortable to use all day in a nail salon. Next, the instructions. It took me way too long to figure out how to change the drill bit, partly due to the vague instructions and partly because I had to use so much force I genuinely thought I was going to break it. The twist mechanism is misleading. You turn it and it stops so you think you're done turning it but in actuality you have to keep turning it until you hear a click.<br />It also would be nice for the manufacturer to explain the differences between all the drill bits and what the intended use case is for each one.<br /><br />FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT CAN'T CHANGE THE DRILL BIT:<br /><br />Turn the top portion of the drill toward the side labeled ""R"" until you hear a click (this is important) use pliers and pull out the drill bit. You'll need to use more force than you think.<br />Once you've removed the drill bit, stop turning the top portion of the drill toward ""R"". The mechanism will go back to the center by itself. Pick your desired drill bit and put it where the old drill bit was.

AETO3634BVKZ5TCAGEO674KNLKHA,B000067E30,4.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:<br /><br />1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don't use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest's instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).<br /><br />2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.<br /><br />2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.<br /><br />Disadvantages<br /><br />1.  The chemical may ""burn"" your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.<br /><br />2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.<br /><br />3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.<br /><br />3.  The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.  If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.<br /><br />Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people.  Over time, you will get a result that should be whiter than when you started.  Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic options.<br /><br />konedog DDS",False,1,1,1,3

I can finally grow my nails out without all the torture in taking gel or tips off and no more sanding down. Yep, supposedly you can use these under acrylic or gel TIPs too! maybe even tips that you glue on? that’s amazing! but I am trying Gelcolor first. We’ll see, I will update in two weeks but so far so good. There are youtube videos demonstrating how easy it is to take them off without any damage... These are amazing. Revolutionary indeed! I will update in weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE: I LOVE THESE GUARDS.... that being said the truth is these lasted for exactly 2 weeks. I think I could of gotten longer if I capped my tips better with gel  because the edge of my nail tips were the first area to start showing wear and ever so sightly the guards at the tip started to peel (2 weeks). It was soo easy to take the Guards and GelColor off, in a matter of a few minutes.  My natural nail is perfect after taking them off... no damage, no dryness, no staining, no brittleness. My tips were white and not stained and my nail beds were a normal pink and best of all they have grown out healthy and are my own nails,  YAY!!!  I will never need fake tips again. I am sooo excite how well these worked.  Honestly they never looked so good after taking off any nail color that includes plain nail polish which would stain my nails and dry out from nail polish remover. The bond of these shields sticks very well and strong. Also anyone having trouble with gel sticking to there natural nails because of their own natural nail chemistry.... this maybe be a great solution for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazing! I have figured out the PERFECT combination to make them last longer then 2 weeks, actually they last  until I am ready to remove. Here’s what I do... I prep my nails using opi nas99 and opi bondaid then I apply the Nail guards, then I apply 2 thin coats of HARD gel I used iBD hard gel (nail builder) right over the Nail Guards, cap the end of the nails well, then I apply 2 coats of color gel (GelColor) and then 1 or 2 coats of OPI Top coat the OPI Top Coat  is stronger then the gelcolor so I usually put 2 coats of top top but 1 is fine, it just depends on what you like, I  like my nails supper glossy, a little thicker, this combination makes them super strong. Caping the NailGuard on the end with iBD Hard gel is the secret to gelcolor lasting longer. This combination last for weeks on end without any peeling or chipping. My nails are now super strong and protected, are healthier,  my manicure stays for weeks on end and best of all it easily comes off when I am ready to take it off with no damage. The only thing is I have to use my regular UV light for the Hard gel (180 sec ea coat of hard gel) to cure and I use my LED OPI Light (30 sec ea coat) for my Gelcolor to cure but it’s 100% worth it!",True,1,0,1,2

It seems to be a nice, high quality costume wig able to fit various head sizes. The tall braid standing up is thick and plump, not likely to deflate or fall over on its own, but it does make the wig a little unbalanced. A real person will be able to compensate easily, but my little foam head here was struggling.<br /><br />This set came with a wig cap, earrings (one had a defect on the ""gem""), a necklace that was lightweight, a spider clip for the hair, and two braid clips. I wasn't really sure what to do with the braid clips or how to clip them into the hair, as there didn't seem to be any flexibility in the prongs to get hair between them, but some searching revealed that they probably should be twisted up around the braid. I did that, as pictured, and you can see how I was able to hide the way the main braid was held in place with a rubber band at the end.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fun little set that I think a fan of the movie Hocus Pocus will get a laugh at.

AFJ22OLIX6JIM7Z3VWL6DC57KEIQ,B007VXJK6E,3.0,"First the good things. It works. In fact, I found the battery life to be outstanding. I took the toothbrush on a 12 day trip and it lasted that long despite only being rated for 10 days. It cleans your teeth pretty well. I also like the pressure indicator that lets you know if you're pushing too hard. Because it's fully functional, I don't feel like I can give it less than 3 stars. But here's why it doesn't get more.<br /><br />First, the brush cycle. I've used other electric toothbrushes that also have the concept of a brush cycle, a beep, series of beeps, difference in the brush, whatever, that informs you to switch to a different area of your mouth. This toothbrush has that too and it works. Then it keeps working. The others I've used ran through the full cycle then turned off. This one, just kept going. You have to manually switch it off before it will stop. It's not a big deal since I know what part of my teeth I'm brushing, but it's part of the general  behavior that I don't like.<br /><br />Next, drool. Again, I've used other tooth brushes and I know that you have to maintain a good seal or you'll spray things everywhere and/or drool all over your chest. But with this brush, I was getting drool despite maintaining a good seal. I was very careful and always was leaking. Why exactly? I'm not sure, but I attribute it somehow to the shape or action or ergonomics.<br /><br />Finally, the easiest to fix, I think the brush is way to strong. If I were to continue using this, I'd need a softer brush.<br /><br />It might just be me, but I'm just not crazy about it even though it works adequately.",False,1,1,1,3

I wanted to try this out before seeing if I should buy the equigroomer. OVERALL, impressed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Dual blades, one for short hairs and one for medium-long hairs.<br />-EASY and reliable self-cleaning, retract the blades and easy to pull off the hair, also like how the hair (as long as you don't have a fan or a large gust of wind) stays on the surface of the comb. Making it easy to collect. and dispose of.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-DOESN'T LOCK into position, so, I'd be mid combing my dogs and the blade would slowly crawl back inside and I'd only realize it since it would start to feel smooth, or there wasn't the expected resistance. SO you have to develop a combing method where your thumb sits behind the slider to keep the blades from retracting.<br />-CHUNKY, not bad for IN-HAND feel, but they made this out to be pocketable, it's not. I mean it is if you have baggy pants or cargo pockets. The thing is about 4x2x1 inches. It's that 1in thickness that kind of hurts the pocketability of this. THOUGH, if you're throwing this in a ""CARE"" bag like a pet version of a ""baby"" bag, then this isn't so bulky that it's going to greatly consume space.<br />-Cheap feeling, I know it's not expensive, but it does feel cheap. Like I don't know if this would survive a fall.<br />-Clogging- while I like that the simple act of retracting the blades pushes the hair out, don't know if the tolerance are there to prevent dander and dead skin from building up and clogging it.<br />-Questionable Shorthaired issues. I have one dog that is clearly medium haired, It's a dutch Shepherd lab mix; and the other is a foxhound catahoula. The foxhoud thinks the longer tooth blade is painful, but the shorter toothed blade is too short for it to be useful. The Dutch/Lab dog has zero issue with the longer tooth comb.<br /><br />Tip:<br />-NOW this might be just logical and common sense to some people, but it took me a while to realize. The best results come from using this product PERPENDICULAR _|_ to the body. I was doing a 45 degree angle and it wasn't catching as much. Also, go with the grain of hair growth not against.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I think it's a great travel comb, and it's well worth the sticker price.

AH2P5OZ4LPSPXQRHJPBOT5EFQGGA,B07Q75WCQH,5.0,"I’ve had numerous rechargeable beard trimmers over the years but I just bought my second one of these (slightly different model number but definitely the same device) and I’m so happy with the product that I just had to write this review. (I am not being paid or compensated in any way, shape or form for this review.) A beard trimmer is the only thing I ever shave with. (Blade and electric razors give me razor burn and PFB.) I’ve used this product every other (sometimes every 3rd or 4th) day for 5 years. I use most of the attachments. The nose hair trimming attachment works great for when my nose hair starts to tickle (it’s never nicked me or pulled a hair out). The longest comb attachment is perfect for when my goatee gets too long - takes it right back down to my preferred length. Some of the shorter comb attachments are great for manscaping - although some care needs to be taken in the southern regions. Occasionally, I’ll snap on the foil shaver - for those times when my wife needs my face to be stubble-free (if you know what I mean ;)  And it’s pretty much flawless when I use it without any attachments as a substitute for a razor/shaver. I would guess that it leaves my stubble about half a millimeter long (~ 1/64”) and the only time it ever pulls a whisker is when I’m shaving against the grain when my whiskers are too long. (In those situations, I need to cut with the grain first, then I can go against the grain to get a closer shave.)<br /><br />The fact that it comes with a 5 year warranty is a big selling point. My first one lasted 5 years and 3 days (Is there a timer in there, or what?!) but I’m OK with that. (Obviously - I replaced it with the exact same thing!) $8 per year for shaving is pretty great! I can’t really give any specifics on the battery life but it seems pretty awesome to me. When it was new, I charged it about every 3 weeks or so. As time went by, that went to two weeks, then one, and for the past few months, I’ve had to plug it in and charge it after every use. I was going to try to replace the LiON battery but I couldn’t figure out how to take it apart without destroying the rubber grip around the handle. Speaking of the handle, the grip is so good that it’s hard to get whiskers off of it; I have to use the little cleaning brush that’s included. Needless to say, it has never slipped out of my hand; I’ve never dropped it. For those who are wondering, it runs off battery only. If it’s out of juice, you can’t just plug it in and use it.<br /><br />If you’ve read the reviews on other beard trimmers, you know it’s a mixed bag out there... under powered, poor battery life, dies after a couple weeks, pulls hair out, etc. Not this one.

The product came well-packaged and with some toe seperators, which was a nice bonus. I also appreciated that it comes in a plastic, TSA-type storage pouch.<br /><br />As for the product itself, there is still some work to do before it's a great product. Firstly, the fact that they do not offer refills yet is a huge deterrent. I've only used mine a few times and the heads are still functioning adequately, but soon I'm sure they won't (particularly the filer) and then it will be useless until they offer refill file heads.<br /><br />Secondly, the file head itself could be of better quality, in terms of filing power. The buff and shine ones are pretty good, but not amazing, as it still takes a little longer than I'd expect to get great results.<br /><br />Finally, because everything just work &#34;okay&#34;, the end result is perfectly fine. Fine is not bad, but I can achieve a better, more fine tuned result with a quality multi-way filing block in only slightly more time. Changing the file heads vs using 1 block for my hands, it's a no brainer I'm better off just using the block.

When I used it, I could feel a couple of bristles poking at my face. Most of them were soft, but these few made the experience less than ideal. On a second use, they seemed a bit softer (but still noticeable), so perhaps over time the lanolin in the soap will work some magic.

I had two types of off repellent. One was in a pump bottle that I had previously used and the other an aerosol can. The pump just ran out so I used the aerosol can which my son probably almost finished. I usually say to spray our cloths, hats or supplies like sleeping bags and sheets, not our skin. I was in my home with a tank top night shirt since it's summer so I sprayed it on my hands and rubbed it on my arms and legs and broke out all over. I didn't think it was that bad at first, but it kept getting worse to the point I was ready to see a dr. I tried witch hazel, kosher activated charcoal, aloe, eucalyptus, tea tree, lavender and probably something else.<br /><br />This body scrub came right on time.

I'm a believer.<br /><br />2016- I'm back for an update, sorry I took a while to get update. Turns out, I did react to the OFF, although there was no mosquito.

And I live in Houston where our humidity can best be described as &#34;lol good luck.&#34; Suffice to say, it's a little bit of a problem especially, during the wet season.

I was sick of lugging around the bulky charger any time I traveled, so when I saw the AA-battery model at Target for $40 I scooped it up.<br /><br />Now instead of having to rely on an internal battery and a charger, I just keep four rechargeable AAs that I swap out when one pair dies. This isn't something I have to do very often--a pair of AAs lasts about a month (that's with two two-minute brushings a day). I have also not had any water damage, so the brush still works as great as my old Sonicare ever did. I do try not to get water on the brush and dry the entire unit whenever I finish using it.

But, from my very limited experience, Aeroblend is an amazing product. It evenly covered my very uneven skin and made it look almost flawless. Aeroblend blended perfectly with my actual skin tone (although maybe I just got lucky and chose the right shade on the first try) so it looks completely natural. I'd been using Art of Air makeup and had to do a lot of mixing and experimenting with different shades every time I put it on. Even then I could never get it just right.

AE23W52LQYC5YMO2EUDRPEXKPGPQ,B0045QGYNM,3.0,"My maternal grandfather passed away some 40 years ago. After my mother returned from her out-of-state trip to be with her mother and bury her father, she gave me a small box containing some of his personal belongings. Among them was his Ever Ready PBT300 shaving brush. I had no use for it at the time. As I unpacked after a recent move I rediscovered this item and decided to use it. It was really enjoyable, so after a few months I decided granddad's brush should be properly retired and I should get my own. Since they no longer manufacture Ever Ready's, I looked here at Amazon. This was the brush I decided upon. It's ok.<br /><br />It is definitely NOT my grandfather's brush - quality-wise. Grand dad was a farmer, and not a gentleman farmer. So he would not have paid a lot for his. So I thought this one might be similar in quality. I was wrong. It's very stiff. It does not do a great job with the soap lather. It also arrived with a very strong, musky aroma in the bristles. This is probably what badgers smell like. But as I am a native of southern California and we don't need no stinkin' badgers here, I am not positive. This aroma was also transferred to my face as well, for the first month of use. Just prior to the musky animal aroma disappearing, I was frustrated enough with the smell on me all day to look for another brush. Since my grandfather's brush had no aroma I knew it was possible to have one that was aroma - free. But was it a matter of quality or simply a matter of time?<br /><br />I purchased a $70 Vulfix brush, hand-made on the Isle of Man in the UK.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It is much more like granddad's in color, feel, and use. It lathers very nicely. It's very soft on the face. It holds a lot of water. There was a slight smell (nothing at all like the SimplyBeautiful smell)that was gone after the 2nd use. If you are thinking about going with a shaving brush (and I LOVE mine and will only go back to the can for short travel trips), my advice is to spend the money and get one that will last for a few decades (like the Vulfix) and avoid the ""badgery"" smell - although it did eventually go away.

While I tanned during the first half of my life, I phased it out during the second. I only use lotion under my eyes where skin is noticeably loose and darker than the rest. Over the past five or six years -- part of this is genetic -- the skin at the front of the neck has become especially loose, while the furrowed lines on my forehead have begun to look alarming. I wanted to try Puressant Neck Firming Cream to see what effect it might have on these two issues.<br /><br />After a three-week trial, during which I applied the product at least once per day, I've seen a subtle but real tightening of the skin on my neck, which appears to have reached maximum effect. I will assume that to continue this trend I might have to use the product indefinitely, but received no indication from product instructions about this. In any case, there are few products I use indefinitely and particularly those with such an extensive list of known and unknown ingredients. Having said that, I might use the product at intervals to reduce symptoms periodically.<br /><br />The product has had no effect on my wrinkly forehead, at least not yet.

AF5UFAV4U2I2S6GTYJJ5CPWOUSLA,B00SLMLOSQ,1.0,"for me it was an unqualified failure.<br /><br />I am trying to treat the knuckle of my right ring finger. It is arthritic and I have treated it very successfully in the past at a clinic that, among other things, used a paraffin bath. The bath was by far the most effective part of my therapy. I didn't want to have something so large to store at home so thought these gloves would be perfect.<br /><br />I am unable to relate to other reviewers who mention the gloves fit almost any hand comfortably. I'm not sure how hands are sized but I can tell you I wear a men's right hand golf glove, size medium and it is a tight fit. The next size up would be the Cadet which, based on the sizes offered at the golf store fits right in the middle of men's sizes. Golf shops allow you to try gloves on without requiring purchase so this may be a good method to see if your hand will fit this product.<br /><br />The first Paraffin Hands glove I tried would not allow my right ring finger more than half way into the finger of the glove. My little finger would only go in to its space by about 25%. Not wanting to force the issue, I left the glove alone and waited the prescribed 10 minutes. No benefit. The second time I tried the same glove, the plastic at the side of the middle finger ripped through to the inside wax while I was trying to get the glove to fit better. Again no benefit after 10 minutes.<br /><br />The second Paraffin Hands glove fit much better, with the ring finger going in to its space about 75% and the same for the little finger. The other fingers went in about 90% being about 10% away from the tip of the glove and the space between fingers also being about 10% away from the palm of my hand. Gently pushing the glove toward my palm to get the best fit caused another break in the plastic of the middle finger so it followed its predecessor into the garbage.<br /><br />This product still sounds like a good idea but the manufacturer really needs to enlarge the size although I am somewhat skeptical there is enough wax in the glove to give one the benefit I am looking for.",True,1,0,1,2

I was able to wear the OR01 all day yesterday, and even through lunch and drinking mugs of tea I didn't need to touch it up 'til the end of the day.  (And, truthfully, since it was the end of the day and there was still a hint of color, I was lazy and just didn't bother.)  The tints aren't noticeably drying, either--although I'm a balm addict and usually put some on over the color throughout the day.  Luckily, this doesn't seem to have a terribly detrimental effect on the color.  There is a slight taste, which is neither unpleasant nor pleasant--I didn't especially like it, but it didn't bother me.  I'm not a wine drinker, but my guess is they don't really taste like wine, just kind of fruity.<br /><br />The only other true tints/stains I've used are the Tony Moly ones and I think these compare favorably to those in terms of ease of application (I think these are more forgiving), durability, drying, and taste (the TMs had a more chemical taste).

I was pretty hesitant to see how well this pink would show up on my dark hair without bleaching it first. Boy was I surprised.<br />First of all, I have a LOT of hair. I needed 3 bottles of dye to cover my whole head. Hopefully you can use my photos to compare your hair length to mine and use what I said to help you determine how many bottles you’d need to buy.<br />I didn’t just pour it in my hands and rub it all over my hair, I actually sectioned out my hair piece by piece to make sure I got the dye on every last bit of hair as evenly as possible. This whole process took about 2 hours. Yes, it was exactly as awful as it sounds. Man were my arms tired.. After I finished dying it, I put all of my hair up in a shower cap / bonnet and let it sit for 5 whole hours. Excessive? Probably lol.<br />I swear I remember hearing once a long time ago that when you wash out hair dye in the shower you’re supposed to keep washing it til the water runs clear. Well I was in the shower for a good 40 minutes shampooing the life outta my hair before I just gave up and got out the shower lol. My shower water continued to run pink every time I washed my hair for at least a good 2 to 3 weeks.<br />Oh and as for the washing?? Yeah I hate cold water so I never did any of that stuff that you’re supposed to do. I continued to shower every to every other day, and I used warm to hot water every time. Yeah yeah I know the color won’t last as long, but screw a cold shower. I also switched to using Herbal Essences Color Me Happy shampoo.<br />[EDIT: I am now aware that Color Me Happy is actually horrible for colored hair. That shampoo still contains SULFATES, which is the ENEMY OF HAIR DYE. So yeah make sure you read the ingredients on your shampoo bottles carefully, because clearly Herbal Essences is a bunch of LIARS.]<br />So after 1 month of warm showers and Herbal Essences, the third photo is what I was left with. I’m honestly incredibly happy!!! The pink definitely faded a lot, but there was still enough pink in my hair to the point where if a stranger on the street saw me they’d be able to say “that girl has pink(ish) hair.” This dye has exceeded all of my expectations.<br />One thing I’d like to add, though. This dye does seem to stain plastic showers. It kinda comes off when you scrub it with acetone (nail polish remover) and some abrasive cleaners. Over time the stains definitely do fade. But I just wanted to give y’all the heads up in case your shower turns pink and you can’t scrub it all off in one night.<br />I’m about to re-dye my hair with this same dye as soon as I finish writing this review, so it might even be brighter and last even longer this time!<br />~TL;DR~<br />1. Shows up great on medium brown hair, but I let it sit for 5 hours before washing.<br />2. Long hair (or at least mine) requires 3 bottles.<br />3. Stains plastic showers.<br />4.

Truth be told, I haven't used the rotating brush head yet, but I LOVE the epilator! They've made so many improvements to the design since I received my last one. The unit charges pretty quickly. I didn't time it but it couldn't have been more than 20 minutes after plugging it in from completely dead that I found it fully recharged. The contour of the unit is also improved, and I love the changes to the on/off dial. It was very easy to accidentally slide the on/off switch on my older model, but this requires two fingers so you won't be accidentally turning it on or off when you don't intend to. The new contouring head is also fantastic. The older model did not pivot with the contour of your legs, but this one works perfectly. The rounded epilator head is protected by the pivoting frame so that when it meets your skin, it is always in the right position. I had jabbed myself a few times with the older model as I was getting used to it. Not painful, but annoying and not effective. It's impossible to do it wrong with this new pivoting head. Overall, I don't feel that it's less painful than previous versions (and underarm hair is still excruciating and I will not do it!) but if you keep up with it every couple of days the pain is extremely minimal. The worst will be when you've let the hair grow out for a while and then do it all at once, and even then it's bearable. I'm glad to see they removed the cold pack from this version because it never helped with the pain despite the claims that it would and the ice on my legs was more uncomfortable than the actual epilating. The weight is just right, not too heavy to fatigue your hands but not too light as to feel like you don't have precise control. And of course, my skin stays smoother longer and epilating removes a lot of the dark spots that are left behind with regular shaving of my very fair skin.

It takes me several minutes to lather enough conditioner off the bar to just somewhat coat my hair.<br />This next part is in regards to my hair results after using this for a few weeks. Note that I have very curly, frizzy, dry hair and have never found a product that has actually helped any of those.<br />My hair feels very light after using this conditioner, which is nice but it also means it's not doing anything for my frizz. Right after getting out of the shower, my hair doesn't feel particularly soft as it has with other conditioners, but once my hair is dry, it feels as soft as it normally does. The scent from the conditioner usually completely goes away by the time my hair is dry, take that as you will. The ends of my hair have been getting more tangled than normal and I often find multiple tiny knots that often won't brush out and end up breaking. I'm no expert on hair so I don't know if this is due to the conditioner not doing what it needs to do or if my hair is just ready to be trimmed again. Either way, it started shortly after switching to this conditioner.<br />Overall, I do plan on sticking with bar conditioner to reduce waste but may look into other options to see if I can get better results.",True,1,1,1,3
AE474XT2KUTOI7TMVG45XKGUJZRA,B07RWY7GLY,4.0,"Bought these because I was looking for something to massage my itchy gums. Though my dentist has not said anything about gingivitis, I am pretty sure I’m borderline there. I have very sensitive gums and have been struggling for years to find toothbrushes that do not stab at them and make them bleed. One time, I tried the floss-tip toothbrush’s & they were SO sharp, they stabbed tiny holes in my gums & they got infected. Since then, I’ve tried Extra Soft Toothbrush from Di Qiu Ren (which was so dense, it did not dry, and got moldy very fast), back to my regular soft bristle toothbrush, which still irritates my gums and makes them bleed, and these silicone bristle brushes.<br /><br />These silicone bristle brushes are very gentle on sensitive gums and have not cause ANY bleeding. Though, it does take longer to get plaque off the teeth, it’s great for my sensitive gums. The downfall, is if you brush your teeth too soon after eating oily foods, the residue sticks to the brush and it very difficult to get off. Most of the time, I just throw it away and use a new one. So far, one brush lasts about a month before it gets residue on it or starts smelling weird.<br /><br />I don’t know if these are good for oral hygiene, but so far, my gums appear better and have built up a tolerance to contact & appear less sensitive to flossing and brushing. I will likely purchase these again to help with my gums, but will continue looking for cleaning alternatives for teeth.",True,1,1,1,3

It does a great job with my (non waterproof) eye makeup as well as foundation - my face is clean! I was surprised how clean it rinsed off - no oily feeling remained at all. My face just feels soft and moisturized. I do follow with a lotion cleanser just to be sure, but you could definitely use it as a stand-alone cleanser.

AFOVVZQGA6LXDUIJUQI4OE3AD5YQ,B075KKRLCJ,5.0,"I've only tried a few different shaving soaps in my time wet shaving. TOBS (Taylor of Old Bond Street) Sandalwood has been my go-to for a few years now.  My only nitpick is the fragrance...which is an oddly clean and powdery sandalwood that projects across my entire bathroom.  The fragrance also has some decent longevity, and I can still pick up notes of it while I'm getting dressed and putting on cologne, which it sometimes clashes with.  I guess my takeaway is that I needed a change from that scent.  Mitchell's Wool Fat soap seemed like a good alternative, and from what I could tell from skimming forums and reviews, it doesn't smell nearly as strongly as TOBS.<br /><br />I'm pleasantly surprised so far.  It lathered in my hard water relatively well.  Just bloomed it in hot water for a minute beforehand and went to work on it with a medium body boarhair brush.  The soap had a slicker feel than I'm used to and the lather had slightly less structural integrity than TOBS but my shave didn't seem to suffer for it.  Like I usually do, I used the remaining lather I'd made to wash the rest of my face, which worked like a charm.  The post shave was just okay.  I honestly felt like I'd done a worse job on my neck than I actually had.  Might have been the switch to a tallow soap, might have been the lanolin but my neck skin felt a little roughed up and gummed up, even after my post-shave alum block and witch hazel.  As my skin dried and everything calmed down, I could finally tell that I'd actually gotten an extremely close shave and had miraculously avoided any damage in the usual spots around my adams apple.  Good stuff.<br /><br />The fragrance is also a nice surprise. The Kent company, which markets and sells a repackaged version of this same soap in India claimed it had elements of Pine, Patchouli, Lavender, Musk, Cloves, Nutmeg, Cedar, Sandalwood.  I now see what the folks on the forums meant when they called that BS.<br />It does have a clean lavender note up front, a bit of soft powdery musk in the middle and a nebulous slightly woodsy note hanging out somewhere in the background.  All the other notes they claimed are MIA though. This is a very subdued version of a classic old-school barbershop scent.  No long distance projection, no longevity past the end of the shave.<br /><br />Actually, now that I smell my hands hours later, I can actually detect a bit of that musky woodsy accord hanging around. After it managed to trigger a sense memory of helping my aunt shear sheep as a kid, I now realize that I'm actually smelling raw lanolin.  So I guess with that in mind, I'd have to reframe this soap as mostly smelling like lavender and lanolin.<br /><br />Which I could definitely get used to.",True,1,0,1,2

AF4CWZIJAUDU6SE3QYUHC5NYQAMA,B09WN3KBDF,2.0,"I wanted to like this product, but overall I'm not particularly impressed with it. The lipstick design is cute, but the entire device is covered in a cheap hard plastic that attracts dust and smudges, and doesn't feel particularly durable. The gemstone tip looks dull and cloudy, and has bubbles within it. Not a pretty pink rose quartz like in the product photos.  The stone also doesn't feel perfectly smooth, but somewhat coarse or tacky.<br /><br />I'm not really certain what the difference between the red and blue light modes is; They both seem to head the gemstone head. The 'button' being a touch sensor makes it easy to switch modes on accidental during use. Perhaps one of the biggest flaws of this device is that the motor is in the base, and the vibrations are extremely weak. This means that you can barely feel the vibrations at all during use. Additionally, the charging port is completely exposed on the bottom of this device with no water-resistant cover, so there's the potentially to accidentally get liquid on it if using this product to encourage product absorption.<br /><br />Overall, I'm highly disappointed with this product.

AF4CWZIJAUDU6SE3QYUHC5NYQAMA,B0BC6PB1GW,4.0,"Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with my order of this spa set. The first thing I noticed is that everything smells fantastic! A strong coffee fragrance wafts from everything in this kit, and all three body products contain real coffee. The scrub was my personal favorite scent-wise; I find it smells just like a caramel lattee.<br /><br />The body bar is nourishing and non-drying, but it is exfoliating due to the coffee grounds, so I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. I do personally wish it was a tad larger, as it melts down quickly during typical usage.<br /><br />The scrub is quite dense, as it doesn't contain added liquid. However, this means you get a lot for your money, as you only need to use a little bit on damp skin to get good exfoliation.  I like the addition of almond and coconut oil, as it keeps it from being overly harsh, and makes it quite hydrating.<br /><br />A little goes a long way with the bath soak. I love using it in a foot bath; It leaves my feet feeling nice and soft, and the aroma is relaxing and pleasant. It does dye the water a light brown due to the coffee, however.<br /><br />I like the candle, but I'd consider it my least favorite out of this set. It has a nice burn time for its size, and it's in a beautiful black candle tin with a lid. However, I found the amount of scent it provided while burning to be underwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this spa kit, and I think it'd be fantastic for any coffee lover.

I also have a teenage daughter who follows the picking and popping type behavior. I've found these tools make it so much easier to get to the hard to reach or deeply embedded blackheads and blemishes and reduce the amount of scarring and marks left by using other things that weren't reall designed for this purpose. They really do help the removal process without damaging the surrounding skin or spreading the bacteria which can lead to even more breakouts.<br />This blemish kit comes with six double sided tools that are made from 100% stainless steel, a zippered leather storage case with elastic loops which hold the tools in place, and an instruction sheet on how to use and care for all of the instruments. This makes the storage and sanitation of these instraments easy and convenient.The tools are definitely of good quality, four of the six have textured grips and are easy to hold on to, the other two are squared. The lance and spoon extractors are stored in the grip, and you simply unscrew them to remove from grip, then choose the desired tool and screw it back in to assemble for use. I really like the lance provided instead of the needle tip lancet, and it's just as sharp. The leather case is nice and small so it would be easy to take in your purse or overnight bag if you should want to travel with it. The elastic loops are tight which makes it a little difficult to replace them, however, I like they have a secured fitted placement.<br />The directions are very clear and basic. It isn't hard to figure out which tool works best for each blemish. Honestly, everyone is different so I don't believe there is one way or one tool that would be more useful then another. That's why this varity is so great.<br />For the best results, it is important to sterilize the tools you will be using with alcohol, and to wash your hands and face with cleanser and warm/hot water. This step is necessary to open the pores and gain maneuverability. Find the appropriate tool and place it over the blackhead and press gently, removing the nastiness by force. If you press too hard you could damage the skin. If you are dealing with a whitehead, puncture it with the lance for removal. It's important to wipe the tool with alcohol prior to moving on to the next blemish, as to not spread bacteria. After you finish with the extractions, it is important that you cleanse your face using cold water. This rinse will help in closing the pores to avoid them becoming clogged again. Don't forget to sterilize any used instruments prior to putting them back in the storage case, you don't want to spread the bacteria.",False,1,0,1,2

I cant really comment on the effectiveness of the Keratin Heat Protector since I don't cook my hair with blow driers, and curling or flat irons. As for the Argan Oil Serum...it's good, but ranks second from my favorite Marrakesh Argan Oil serum.<br /><br />Overall, these products are okay, but nothing to write home about. My biggest concern was when I was using these 3 products, my hair seemed to fall out...and I mean hair loss by the clumps. Never had this happen before. I didn't panic right away and blame it on the products, but after a week or so, I discontinued using Milania products and went back to my prior products and immediately noticed no hair falling out. So did the Milania products have something to do with my hair falling out? I can't say for certain, but I did read a review here that someone else experienced hair falling out too. I understand that everyone's hair & scalp is different and mine seem to react poorly, so use your own judgement call on whether you want to try these products.<br /><br />Aside from ""possible"" hair loss, the products smelled incredible, distributed easily in hair, and didnt leave any residue feeling in my hair. So my final judgement on Milania hair care is that it's basic stuff and, in my opinion, overrated and didn't live up to all the hype.

Not a bad scent but for me I need my sweet Gourmond scents to be stronger than this and last much longer than 30 minutes to 1hr at best.

I did find the bleach a bit runny, but it didn't matter since I just used foils to go under my sections as I painted the bleach on (And later, I did the same for the dye) I used Pink Fetish AND Lusty Lavender. You really need to ensure you use enough of the coloring since your hair WILL soak it up quickly, so you need NOT to be skimpy.<br />I painted it on and rubbed it in with my gloves hands before wrapping with the foil. I finally cleaned up any drips etc and covered with a plastic cap.... I rinsed and used shampoo (yeah, I didn't look) and it faded the color quite a bit... still cute but I wanted NEON. I waited until the next day, did it again and Voila! PERFECT!<br />You need patience, some experience or a friend with experience, a steady hand and about 4-6 hours to do a great job.

The 4th cat always grooms his chin on a prickly squishy ball.<br />The brushes that arrived are hard plastic. Instructions were not included, so I had to revisit the website before pouring catnip in the back of the wall brush. Everyone sniffed it but only 2 tried to rub up against it. At first I had it secured to the bottom of a stool, but once I attached it higher up the legs, the cats nudged at it. It’s been in the cat room for over a week. The cats have not paid it much attention. I moved near the other grooming toys, but no improvement. Maybe the catnip is not so potent or maybe I need to pour the entire bag inside? Not sure?

AHNLOFTL5LI2QTNQYSQRQY2FABAQ,B00KXFD75M,2.0,"I decided to purchase a scar remover treatment in order to lighten eczema-related scarring on my lower leg that has lingered since childhood.  After reading positive reviews regarding the Protege Flawless product, I thought I would give it a try.  The consistency is disgusting, the color is gross, and the &#34;scent&#34; is an odd fruity-type scent that isn't pleasing by any means.  Every time I open up the jar, there is a very unappealing product inside.  Nonetheless, I went ahead and began using it and after only a few weeks, I have noticed a small difference.  My scarring does look lighter, so that's a good thing.  However, I think my product has already turned stale!  I have closed it tight after each use, but it seems to have changed.  It looks the same, but the &#34;scent&#34; is now completely atrocious!  There's not a trace of that barely &#34;fruity&#34; scent anymore.  It has turned into a putrid smell, and I almost can't even bear to use it.  It seems as if almost overnight it turned from barely fruity to entirely unbearable.  I can't even put my finger on what it smells like now.  The best way to describe the smell is &#34;chemical,&#34; which leads me to think this may not be as natural of a product as the company claims.  I've rated this two stars only because it seems to have done something for the better, but I am going to switch to another product.  This is much too expensive for it to turn stale so quickly.",True,1,1,1,3
AH6MCANON5U3KBUJGT2NAHBC6WWQ,B0067BAIM6,5.0,"I was hesitant reading reviews before I purchased this item.  The reviews were so mixed I wasn't sure what to think.  After looking at it for several days I bought it anyway to give it a try.  I bought the rechargeable one.  I don't understand what the negative reviews were all about.  My feet are AWFUL.  I have a thick layer of dryness around my heels and the inner part of my big toes.  This isn't something to use one time and then expect your feet to be smooth forever.  You have to use it every couple of weeks or so.  My problem is I do not put lotion on my feet.  I hate the feeling, it makes my feet feel dirty.  I wear flip flops all year long (live in Arizona where it's hot all the time) and I'm sure that's the reason they are so terrible.  After one use you can feel a major difference.  It basically works the same as the foot files you would use except for since it's electric you don't have to do that whole scrubbing back and forth.  If your feet aren't that bad off you may not want it.  This is a definite great purchase, in my opinion.  I do recommend you do it outside as the powdery stuff that comes off your feet when you use is goes all over the place.  I have a ped-egg and it's basically the same except the ped-egg has a catch all compartment that the powder goes into that you empty later.  The ped-egg also kinda cuts your feet all up so a few days later you can feel the hundreds of little straggly skin snag on your sheets at night or on your socks.  I do it in the grassy part of my backyard and there's no clean up.  The first time I pretty much had to sweep and vacuum my bathroom floor right after.  It's a pretty nasty thought considering it's dead skin cells that are all over.  I've had it a couple months now, used it about 5 times and it doesn't seem that I'm close to needing a refill yet.

The nail polish doesn't stay on for long :(<br /><br />I saw this kind of nail polish some years ago and thought it was really cool.  My wife wanted to get it but it was a bit too pricey at the time so she never got it.<br /><br />Times have changed and we were able to finally get these.  As UPS dropped off the package, my wife tackled him and grabbed the box because she was so excited.  She ripped the box wide open and started doing her nails right there in the grass.  Okay, okay that's not really true.  But she was really excited and did try it out right away - the UPS guy was not harmed.<br /><br />I'm a dude so pink is pink.  I ordered pink and the product is pink.  Looks good.  In the bottle, and when it is first applied, it looks like regular metallic nail polish.  No big deal, right?  Well, they include two different magnets, each with a different design.  After the polish is applied to the nails, you have to immediately place the magnet over the nail while being careful to not actually touch the nail with the magnet.  Hold it there for a little bit (I think it said 15 seconds), then it magically has a cool design.  I think it's really cool how it does that.<br /><br />My six year old daughter was amazed just as much as I was.  Actually, maybe a little less than I was.  Lol.  We told to get to bed early and then if mommy and her wake up early enough before school, then she can have her nails done with Magnetix.  She's pretty excited.  Yes we are very excited family tonight...haha.  Seriously, it's pretty cool.

The hair comes in 3 (or in my case 6) individual packs (PIC) with a twist wire going through. Care must be taken to not let each piece slip off until you are used to the loop because you may lose the grip of the loop. The loop holes are pretty small so you'll lose some strands if you cant get a hold of the loop properly because the hair will unravel if you manipulate it too much (PICs). Also the hair is a bit too shiny to look natural (PIC) although I still got compliments. It comes with hair clips and a loop needle package (PIC) with each order so I wound up with two needles and two sets of clips. At this point I've had it in one week and though it still looks ok, there is a lot of frizzing up at the root so I'm not going to be able to wear it for a month like i planned, I can tell already. Didn't notice any real shedding though the unraveling makes up for it. It'd probably better to order an extra pack if you want to wear it for a while since you should switch out the individual locs as they fray. Lastly the metal clips that are included are nice to cap off the look, but they tarnish pretty quickly.  The hair is veeery soft and 18&quot; is the length I wanted it to be.",True,1,1,0,2

I did not want to spend a future at a salon because.... she is five!<br />She DOES love the end result but I will say, if you want a successful process I have several important notes.<br />1. I can NOT speak to the bleach because we did NOT use it. I hear BAD things about it.... so, read other reviews if applicable.<br />2. Product is messy! That said; count on the NEED for 2 person application. Do NOT attempt to self apply this product. Will absolutely regret it and ruin your home and clothes.<br />3. Count on purchasing extra items AND plan for 3 hours from prep start to finish. I will explain why.<br />EXTRA ITEMS: This product will ABSOLUTELY stain hand, face and scalp. Purchase: extra gloves, vaseline, and hair dye removal!<br />GLOVES: It only comes with one crappy pair of gloves. For best result, swing by Sally's beauty and buy SEVERAL good pairs of gloves. OR buy some of those thick bathroom cleaning gloves that come to your elbows. this way you can use them and take them off and on easily to both apply AND rinse hair.<br />VASELINE: COMPLETELY coat ears, forehead, neck, etc with a THICK coat of vaseline to avoid staining<br />DYE REMOVAL: Swing by sally's and buy a bottle of hair dye remover BEFORE you start. This will get on skin and you will NOT get it off otherwise.<br />EXTRA TIME TO APPLY: I have applied this product in 4 different colors to both my own hair and others hair. I have NEVER gotten good coverage without having to apply it TWICE. (including this application. pictures attached are product of applying BOTH colors twice for an hour each time) For the vibrant color you will want, count on applying, waiting an hour to rinse. Blow dry and reapply for ANOTHER hour.  Do not think you will ""quickly"" apply this product like a box of normal 20 minute color. You will be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, as I said, my daughter is happy with the turn out and I saved money so in my case, it worked out.<br />However, I have experience with this product so it was successful based on ALL the above notes.<br />Also, I DID experience severe staining to her scalp and it will NOT come off so far even with the hair dye remover. I did not apply it close to scalp but she is young and her hair is so thin, it bleed right through and left big nasty looking spots all over her little head.

I remember thinking about it and just remembering what the bottle looked like, I would ask every person at every drugstore to help me find it.  Then one day at the grocery store I ran across it while looking for something else!

It doesn't make your hands sticky, which is what one would think after first pouring it into your hands.

This stuff is amazing, I have now removed all lotions from my bathroom and bedside table and will only use this from now on.  At my age I should know that if it ain't broke, don't fix it!  Trust me, no matter how dry your skin is or what shape your skin is, this is the magic in a bottle that will work for you.

I've used 400 degree irons resulting in barely a wave... ive even had my hair professionally curled. And the curls lasted for about 2 hours before I was a frizzy disaster.  For the last few years I had all but given up on my dream of a head of locks. Until now that is!<br />I saw this bed head rock n roller for just 30 bucks on prime.. I figured I'd most likely return it but wanted to try because of the reviews. And I am sooo glad I did! IT WORKS!!! HALLELUJAH! IT ACTUALLY WORKS!<br />My hair curled with EASE! Like so easily! I am seriously shocked... and so happy with this purchase. 2 of my good friends have already purchased this since they saw me with curls! They know how my hair is impossible to curl, but they saw it themselves!<br />Ok about the actual product... it has heat setting from low to high and anywhere in between, you can make big or small curls with the bumps (either spiraling over the bumps for bigger curls, or in between bumps for tighter curls.....or a fun messy mix of both), it has a nice long cord for easy movement and it heats up in literally 90 seconds.... no more waiting 10 minutes for a potential fire to start. I tried using the glove but it just got in my way of seperating hair.. you dont need it though anyway. Best part about it... it actually curls hair! (Imagine my surprise lol)<br />I played with it as soon as it arrived.. I put some curls in my hair and my 5 yr old daughters hair too... we were in for the night and after I easily gave us 2 happy heads of locks we went to sleep. THE NEXT MORNING I woke up with damn near perfect curls still in tact! The both of us did! I didn't even use hairspray! And I am like the energizer bunny in my sleep and my 5 yr old is...well, 5. We all know how they move in their sleep!  So I was totally shocked that they stayed in all night! Im putting up a pic from the morning after we curled..still in pjs lol... i didnt take one that night, bc i was planning on doing it better before posting a pic lol but i have to share the morning after pic bc it was such a wonderful moment in my life lol; to realize I could now curl my hair after 29 years of life!<br />So overall, yes!

I prefer it that way (less stuff in the landfill).<br /><br />If you're expecting a manual with it, then this product is probably not for you, safety-wise, and I mean that most respectfully. I guess it might say &#34;Insert in ear, please be super careful&#34;. This is the kind of thing they usually don't sell in the US (at least from a big company) due to liability. Especially with the ear, the rule is &#34;Only let a doctor do it&#34; (like it is for so many things). Let me tell you, the doctors I've seen don't want to do it either (would you?). They give you the 'yuk, that's beneath me' look and refer you to earwax drops (which never worked for us). I guess what I mean is that if you're looking at buying this, you've probably tried to clean your ear with other (usually unsuitable) objects (Q-tips, etc) without much success, so you have some experience on what's safe to do and how you might use this. Again, you have to be super careful.<br /><br />Now my short experience with this is to clean out the wax of another (elderly) person, not my own. I don't need it (yet), tho I suspect it's much more effective when you can see what you're doing, which you cant on yourself. Also, I think by restricting your cleaning to what you can see, you're less likely to go too deep (like you might on yourself). It works really well on dry, flaky wax. On more wet, viscous wax, I cant say. Compared to what I've used before, it's no contest. I'm really happy with it. So much more wax than I've been able to get out before.<br /><br />There are three tools, each with its own usefulness that is apparent or you can figure out as you go. One is for (dull) scraping (looks like a round paw), one is for twisting/catching loose stuff (bulb-shaped spring), and one seems like a combo of both (looks like a mace w/three ridges). The last one has edges that are a little sharp, which you might need (use gently), but can be painful on the delicate skin of the inner ear. I've seen bleeding from using a Q-tip too much, so be careful.<br /><br />I would clean these after every use. I use isopropyl alcohol (cheap from walmart).<br /><br />The plastic case is plain and flimsy, like a throwaway case, but is actually very useful (so don't toss it).

Both videos are videos in *.mp4 format, with the 2003 video being 753 MB in size, and the 2013 video being 1.43 GB in size.<br /><br />LENGTH<br /><br />The new edition is billed as an updated/expanded version, and that's clearly evident when you compare the length of the two videos:<br />2003 version: 1 hour 44 minutes<br />2013 version: 3 hours 48 minutes<br /><br />DIFFERENCES<br /><br />So what's the difference exactly?  Well for starters, Oz himself is now 10 years older, and has a lot more professional experience under his belt.  He has a new look and even a new smile.  Everything has been re-filmed and the explanations have been re-done from scratch.  Most of the content covers the same material, but not exactly - I'll mention what exactly those differences are in the next section.<br /><br />CONTENT ON THE ORIGINAL 2003 EDITION ONLY<br /><br />Not everything that was in the 2003 edition of the DVD is found in the 2013 edition, and several sections from the original have vanished.  These are the following:<br />a) Controls: - Classic Pass; - Hindu Shuffle Pass; - One Handed Top Palm; - Elmsley Count<br />b) Forces: - Riffle Force<br /><br />CONTENT ON THE NEW 2003 EDITION ONLY<br /><br />The new edition is about twice as long, and that's because some of the explanations are more detailed and elaborate, but also because it has some new material. Here's a list of all the new topics:<br />a) Controls: - Gamblers Cop; - False Overhand Shuffle<br />b) Forces: - Dribble Force; - Spread Cull Force<br />c) Flourishes: - Swivel Change<br />d) Routines: - Slop Shuffle; - Card to Mouth; - Blossom Production<br /><br />COMPARISON<br /><br />It's a pity to see some material from the original version left out in the new version, especially the Riffle Force (given its popularity), and the Elmsley Count (given that it is used in so many tricks).  I'm also curious why a decision was made to eliminate the Pass, although this is a more advanced move that is typically beyond the scope of beginners, and perhaps that's why it was removed.  If material was going to be added, the Glide would have been an obvious addition as a fairly basic sleight, so I'm surprised that this continues to be an omission from what is intended to be a good introduction to fundamentals.<br /><br />But the additional elements are very solid, and the increased number of routines in the new version will especially be welcome to many people.  What I like most, however, is the fact that the sleights and moves are taught in a little more detail, and I think the more elaborate explanations here are very helpful.<br /><br />Oz himself appears to have lost some of his youthful innocence, and comes across a little more brash and almost over-confident.  I'm still not quite sure what to make of his new business suit attired persona, or whether I prefer the younger Oz.  But he is still an excellent teacher, and that's really what this video is all about.  It's always been an excellent choice for relative beginners looking to get a good handle on the fundamentals of card magic, and overall this enhanced version only makes a good thing even better.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br /><br />Oz Pearlman's &#34;Born to Perform Card Magic&#34; DVD has always been applauded for being a great introduction to the fundamentals of card magic, and one of the better entries in this genre.  The updated and expanded 2013 edition takes something that is a proven success, and expands it for a new audience that may not be familiar with the original.  It still deserves to be one of the top recommendations for new magicians, and continues to be an excellent starting point to give beginners a good head-start with their card magic.<br /><br />- BoardGameGeek reviewer EndersGame",False,1,0,1,2

I bought this because I recently had surgery that affected my hair (medications and anesthesia) made my hair very brittle and I began loosing it.  My stylist recommended we try this since it was all natural and would not hurt the new hair growth.<br /><br />This product was a joke. My stylist mixed to specifications included with the henna, mix with water apply and wait 45-60 mins.  This stuff smells like baby food, and felt like mud on my hair.<br /><br />After 60 mins he washed with water, per instructions.  My hair was limp, and dull. There was no color change to the gray hair, and the dark hair seemed a little darker, but not much.<br /><br />I waited the 48 hours like it said before washing with soap (non dandruff shampoo since this could cause your hair to turn green) this was not on the packaging but was included from the shipper on invoice. I had to lather, rinse 3 times before my hair felt clean, then I had to apply a conditioner and let it sit for 5 mins to get the hair to feel tangle free.<br /><br />So in the long run I ended up still having the gray hair. Which was the reason I ordered this to cover it. I followed all directions, and even ordered 2 shades darker then my own hair.<br /><br />Guess I will use the remaining powder for tattoos or fertilizer in my organic garden.",True,1,0,1,2
AHFV3KVID6XUQJASBDOELH3VBHOA,B08YYLJLQJ,4.0,"This works great! You just have to know how to use it correctly. The double curler band allows you to use less hair on each curler so that the hair dries faster and curls faster. Here IS MY 2 HOURS TO PRETTY CURLS METHOD: Part upper hair at crown of head,  and put hair from the upper head at crown,  in a pony tail for later. Snap the curling system closed, so that there is 2 round circle bands to use to curl with, and put both around head like a double crown head band. Push the top curling band where pont tail is for later use. Separate the bottom layer of hair into two parts... left side and right side and use only the bottom circle band curler for the bottom portion of head. Begin curling in left side by spritzing a little water onto the hair at root and curl it under band tucking it under and around curler one time only and then in next pass, grab a little more hair with it and continue going around the curler band. Keep spritzing new hair with water each time you pick up a new piece of hair and add that hair to the previous end of the one you just curled, until the whole left, bottom  side is done. Then start on the bottom right side of hair. When finished,  the  whole bottom curling band  will be filled with the hair from the lower portion of. Now it's time to take out the pony tail that was  on the grown of head  and put that hair under the second curling band and separate the left side of hair from the right. Start curling the left upper part of head as you did the bottom portion... spritzing small portion of hair with water at root and curling it once around the band and then pick up a little more new hair, spritz it with water and curl together with the former portion around band until all left side is done and now do right side. DO NOT SOAK HAIR.  Only LIGHTLY MIST IT a little with water or it wont dry in 2 hours. Dont curl too big a portion of hair at a time either, or it won't dry in two hours. Wait about 1 hour to 2 hours and remove curlers and you will get beachy type ringlets that are big. It takes about 10 minutes to wind hair around curlers. Lovely curls.",True,1,0,1,2

AE2GO5B2SWCBHIYMOE45YWL7RQHA,B006UNQ1PO,5.0,"I rate the unscented version of this fragrance five stars.  It lathers and rinses well (I tried it out not only on my baby, but also on myself, to test it on long, thick hair).  It leaves hair fairly manageable, even without additional use of a conditioner.  It does have a noticeable soapy smell, but it's not unpleasant.  Best nontoxic shampoo I've found for my baby thus far.  (We also got the Earth Mama Angel Baby Non-Scents shampoo, but it didn't leave baby's hair feeling manageable, and my husband also thought it left his hair smelling like vomit.)<br /><br />HOWEVER, parents of babies with sensitive skin please note that the scented versions contain SYNTHETIC FRAGRANCE (or at least the pear scent does).  I wrote to the manufacturer to inquire about it, and the below is the reply that I got.  I thought it was pretty sketchy that the manufacturer did not disclose this in the product description (and in fact includes misleading information - saying the product is 100% plant-based, and only that ""Aroma May Contain Fruit Extracts or Fruit Oils"").  Our baby has sensitive skin and a history of eczema, so we got the unscented version, with which we've been very pleased.  Just wanted to sure in case this is helpful for other parents of babies with sensitive skin.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Reply From Paradise Island Organics customer service, 3/14/14:<br /><br />""I heard back about the Pear Scent from the manufacturers.  The Pear scent is synthetic and does not contain any real pears.  The pear fruit does produce an essential oil, however, it takes 20 tons of pears to produce about 3 ounces of essential oil, which is why it is not available to purchase.  But, the synthetic pear scent we use is free of phthalates, parabens, nitro musk, sulfates, glycols, petrochemicals, formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasing agents.  Using pear extract or flavor is an option we are looking into for the future, but it depends on how strong the extract or flavor is on how well it holds the scent in personal care products.  Some particular fruits hold the scent much better than other fruits.  But, we will certainly look into having our chemist test it to see if the pear extract or flavor scent would hold well in our shampoo for the future.<br /><br />If you have any more questions, let me know and I'd be happy to help.<br />Have a good weekend!<br />Sincerely,<br />Camille Scott<br />Sweet Baby Shampoo""",True,1,0,1,2

I saw that the reviews might have been fluffed but decided for the price it was worth a shot.  So far I think i really like it, it might even be worthy of five stars for the price. I actually ordered a second bottle of the other scent and will see how I like that.  The scent isnt bad, kinda beachy, its not great, just okay. The color however is nice. Before this i used paint it black and other variations of those cheap 13ounce brands on here. The only one that seemed to work okay was the tingle one and I hated seeing people I knew after the tanner, hugging them, then remembering I had to remind them their face might burn off in the next 20 minutes. So to save the embarrassment I decided to find a not tingle tanning lotion that worked to give me color.  This one clearly has bronzers because my nails and in between my fingers can get stained since I leave it on a few hours after the tanner.  I would say watch out for this, it can be a good thing and a bad thing, good because you know you will get color but bad because it can leave your hands sorta strange looking, its not as horrible as a sunless tanner product and shouldnt stain clothes but be aware of it.  The consistency is strange, seems high in silicone because when I apply it its like im rubbing lube all over me.  Not awful just a new texture from what im used to. It does spread easily tho which is nice and it seems to soak up pretty good too and not leave me super greasy.  Over all for the size and price I like it, the biggest downside is having to carry around such a large bottle every time i tan.  Will let you know how I like the other scent.",True,1,0,1,2
AF6S7E5HLR5NMW7RIMZDCKUL6OKA,B01AYTGWA8,5.0,"I've been getting into nail art, uv gel polish, and nail stamping plates of late, and acetone was chewing up my nails so they were dry and thin.  I saw that this product was being offered during Prime Day, so I decided to purchase and try this product.  I have tried it on both regular polish as well as uv-light cured gel polish.  I must say, I prefer to use this on normal polish only.  It gradually removes the polish, and leaves a nicely scented, moisturizing residue behind that really conditions my nails.  I was much less successful using this product to remove my uv gel polish, but I'm also not surprised.  I may read more reviews for tips, but I am content just using this for removing regular polish and nail stamping art.  Now here is the miraculous part...  I had nail stickers on my nails for 3 weeks, and for whatever reason (the acetone, the pre-application buffing, etc) to put those on left my nails SUPER thin.  They would split and flake if I even tried to grow my nails out longer than my fingertip.  I noticed that after using this to clean my nails after my weekly cuticle removal process, my nails looked really moisturized and clean.  Then, I would top off my thin nails with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails so they wouldn't be so plain.  I'm not sure if it was because the SHHAN sealed in whatever essential oils are in this remover, but my nails grew so fast and bounced back stronger than ever so I was able to grow them out very long past my fingertip!  I literally could bang my nail tips on any surface and I could feel the strength.

As soon as I received the replacement, I started getting e-mails from Simon asking me to remove all my pictures and to give the product a 5-star rating. I ignored the e-mail at first until he repeatedly e-mailed me telling me to remove the photos and give a 5-star rating, neither of which I agreed to. I wanted to make sure it was not defective before I reviewed again.

AG5QUMRI6AFUYPNDSK4EEJZ5R3CQ,B01DPZKAGK,4.0,"I want to start by saying that most of the poor reviews of the SilverWhite line are written by people who clearly don't know what they're doing. This is for light hair, as in WHITE or platinum blonde. If your hair is not light enough, you won't get the results you're looking for, and that isn't the product's fault. With that in mind, these colors are a wonderful alternative to custom silver formulas that require mixing many shades!<br /><br />I've been dyeing my hair silver for years and I've tried just about every brand of &#34;silver&#34; dye out there with various amounts of success. My hair is naturally a cool dark blonde (ranging from level 7 to 8) and I have to bleach my roots twice to get them light enough for a proper, no brassiness silver. I currently use the Wella T18 toner + 050 for the length of my hair, and do my newly bleached roots with Schwartzkopf Slate Grey + E-1, which fades and blends nicely as new roots grow out. I use Fanola No Yellow shampoo to maintain it. This is a 1:1 dye, meaning you should use the same amount of developer as dye. The great thing about this line is that the dye truly doesn't have any warm undertones (with the exception of the dove grey, which is still cooler than most silvers). I like to add a little E-1 to the slate grey because as with every dye, no matter what brand you use, the cool pigment is the first to fade and adding this extra purple gives it a little more staying power.<br /><br />I've found that the slate grey does fade more quickly than you would expect from a permanent dye, as it is meant for hair that is naturally grey and has a transparent quality that helps match new grow out; this transparency will also make it VERY obvious if you have any brassy areas or your hair isn't light enough to begin with. Using 20 vol. developer instead of 10 (as is recommended) helps with permanency. The lilac shade also seems to last longer than the other three.<br /><br />As for being true to color, the slate grey tends to come out darker than shown, and you have to pay close attention to processing time with the silver, which does lean slightly blue and can really take over if you leave it on too long. The dye is relatively gentle since you're using 10 or 20 vol, but don't be tempted to let it process for more than twenty minutes. Both of these color issues will fade within a couple washes if you do though.<br /><br />TLDR:<br />These are really great cool shades with little to no warmth and stay true to that as they fade, but<br />- You MUST have white or near white hair<br />- Most SilverWhite shades fade quickly, so use 20 vol. developer<br />- Slate grey is dark and silver leans blue; don't over-process unless you want that",True,1,0,1,2

The itching seemed to spread from the eyes tear drainage system into the nose and up into the sinus by the nose/eyes and forehead. Awful strange, strong itching.<br />Next day (I never took the drops again, have thrown them away); the eyes are very soar and sinus has extreme pressure, crawling feeling and pain. I think the eye drops caused the pollen, mold, chemicals to flow through from the eye-tear drainage tube into the nose, then up the sinus when I was sniffling in the rain yesterday. Today pain still bad but itching less. Following day two; no drops for 3rd day; pain, itching less. Pain gone after days no eye drops.

You can use it as a brush holder and you can use it store brushes. I am using the shorter half as a brush holder and find that it blends in nicely with my other holders.<br /><br />Now I’ll do a brief breakdown of the brushes and sponge.<br /><br />The lip brush is great and it blends in my lipsticks really nice.<br /><br />There are three brushes for eyes- eyeshadow brush, blending brush and angled liner. I have tried these and they are very soft and work very well.<br /><br />The powder brush is a bit smaller than I would personally like for powder. It’s not quite dense but in a brush that is used for powder products that’s okay. When I’m buffing in the powder I don’t want the brush to be too dense or it will move the foundation around. I’ve been using this brush for blush because of it’s smaller shape and it’s working great.<br /><br />Now the final two- the foundation brush and the sponge. I decided to do half of my foundation with the brush on one side, and the other half with the sponge on the other side.<br /><br />The foundation brush is a typical brush of it’s kind. It did not make the foundation look streaky and applied very smooth.<br /><br />The sponge is the most interesting piece in this set. It doesn’t feel super soft like a Beauty Blender or a Real Techniques sponge. It feels like a softer stress ball and feels a bit rubbery. I’ve never had a sponge like this. I soaked the sponge in water and drained the excess as I would do with any sponge. It felt heavier but did seem to soften a bit and did expand in size. I dabbed the foundation on my face and pressed the sponge around to press the product in and I got a really smooth finish. The sponge did not seem to absorb much product.<br /><br />Overall I think it’s a very nice set!<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

AEVWJ4AZJF2I6WZ3KRAZOYHZIRAA,B006JZ0L7C,4.0,"Let me preface this by saying that the colors are pretty and generally well pigmented (I use it with Too Faced Shadow Insurance).  My issue is that many of the colors are very glittery - I like shimmery shadows, but we are talking big chunks of glitter here in several of the colors.  If you're familiar with Urban Decay's ""Midnight Cowgirl"" shadow family you'll get the picture.  Basically the entire palette is gliterry, except for two matte shades. If you get this, make sure to put a tissue under your eyes to catch the fall-out or you'll look like a disco ball.  I'm talking serious fall-out here.<br /><br />The colors are:<br /><br />Full Moon: Glittery Champagne<br />Night Light:  Supremely Glittery rosey pink (this one has a chalky texture, making it impossible to apply without massive fallout.)<br />Spotlight: Matte Beige<br />Nightcap: Shimmery medium tan<br />After Hours:  Chalky glittery medium beige<br />Moonstone:  Glittery deep tan<br />Cocoa Star:  Matte chocolate brown<br />Eclipse: Glittery Chestnut brown<br />Night Fever: Glittery Chocolate brown<br /><br />The positives:  The packaging is cute, the colors are fairly pigmented, Too Faced includes looks cards so you can get ideas on looks.<br /><br />The negatives:  This is only a good palette if you already have a nice collection of eyeshadow and you want something to throw in your purse when you're going out of town and know you'll be partying (and you have the patience to deal with massive fallout).  You can definitely make some work appropriate looks, but these are more glittery than shimmery, making it a bit juvenile.  Some of the shadows are chalky too. I also have the Urban Decay Naked palette and the colors are MUCH better, as is the quality of the shadows.  Personally I think Naked is also a better deal.  It's $50, so $14 more, but you get more colors, the shadows are better quality (creamier and smoother), and it comes with a nice brush.<br /><br />I find that I don't use this palette much.  It isn't a palette that has an obvious place in my makeup collection.<br /><br />Updated:  I am still experimenting with this palette (I brought it in my makeup bag on vacation and left my UD Naked palette at home) and I've definitely created some nice looks that are completely appropriate for daily life.  I just don't LOVE it.  The problem is, I have the Urban Decay Naked palette.  The colors are similar between UD Naked and TF Natural at Night (warm browns and champagnes) but the Urban Decay colors are shimmers (I love shimmers) and many of the shads in the Too Faced Naked at Night palette are glitters.  That makes the TF colors much harder to work with due to fallout.  Ultimately, this palette is 3.5 stars to me.  It has nice colors and you can create some great looks (provided you put tissue under your eyes to catch the fallout), but the UD Naked Palette is just better in my opinion in terms of pigmentation, ease of application, and blending.",False,1,1,1,3

Overall it seems well made and like it will last quite a while.<br /><br />I haven't had it long and have actually only used it once, but just once made a huge difference. I did not follow directions and soak my feet for 10-30 minutes in salt water. I simple took a shower, dried my feet, and used the file on both feet for 5 minutes total. If I had soaked my feet I'm sure I would have got even better results. I also put aloe lotion on my feet after. I never put lotion on my feet and they're usually very dry and cracked because of that. I intend to use the file every day for the next couple days briefly after I shower until I get my feet looking good. After doing so I'll add the lotion as part of the regimen.

I’ve received things faster ordering them from China! Then, once I got it, I tried it out (see pics). The colors are nice, but not extremely impressive.

The box it comes in, the plastic that holds it, and the machine itself is sturdy.<br />The drill bits can be stored in a little case that pops open when you push the button on the mid-bottom portion of the case.

(The origional images were lost so I had to retake them after I had tested it. Sorry, I like to take picture of it before use. So excuse the arcylic bits from the nail.)<br />* It was powerful enough to file acrylic nails but it did get warm around the last nail. Not hot just warm it was pretty good for shaping all 10 acrylic nails.<br />*Grip it well but just gradually add pressure to the nail if you are a beginner until you get the feel of it.<br />*You have to hold it down for 3 seconds to turn it on after plugging it in.

After like, 3 days of use I happened to look down at my hair one day and it just hit me that I didn't have any frizz  or areas that looked wild and untamed from breakage, the hairs that would normally have 2 or 3 splits or frays were just smooth all the way down.

I usually like coconut scents, it's always been my favorite, but this smells more floral and a little spicy, which maybe sounds weird but I think it's soooo good.<br /><br />It lathers up surprisingly well for an Argan Oil shampoo and I don't have to use much for my bra strap length hair. My hair is really thick, too, but a good quarter sized dallop works out to be about the right amount for me. I do the ends and body first and work my way up to my scalp, backwards from how I use regular shampoo. (I do this because some brands seem to leave my hair oily if I don't get it rinsed out well, that Argan Oil can be stubborn.) I usually let it set for a couple minutes while I wash my body so the hair can absorb the nutrients before I rinse it away. I follow it with their conditioner and my hair gets sooo soft when it dries. I really can't stress enough how well it helps my hair. I know everyone responds differently but for me, it's better than anything else I've tried. I'll be ordering this again for sure.<br /><br />I did receive my Argain oil shampoo at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes.

AEU5ATUZSY22XUDTJHF755PMWFSQ,B01AC82KQQ,4.0,"I have color treated hair that I've been dying for about 8 years now and I have to really maintain it to keep it healthy and looking smooth. I learned some time ago how much better my hair looks when I use Argan Oil treatments and would do them once a week or so to make my hair super soft and pretty. I started using shampoos and conditioners with Argan Oil when I saw how well my hair responded to it. Some brands left my hair feeling heavy and oily so I really wanted to find a good clarifying shampoo. I started with just a little bit so I could gauge how it would work for me but once I lathered it up in my hair I realized how much a little bit can cover. I don't need nearly as much as I do of most other brands. I washed it that night and followed it up with my regular conditioner, another Argan product. My hair felt really clean. I have a lot of hair and at the top I couldnt feel the heaviness and resistance I had been from over moisturizing. The smell was ok, I like something that is stronger and prettier, this one just kind of smelled like soap, and it faded quickly after It was dry. As long as my conditioner smells good I don't mind it too much but if you're planning to use it alone you might notice. I think it worked well for getting it clean without leaving it dry or feeling like straw. I don't feel like my hair is as soft as with most Argan Oil shampoos, at all, but I think it'll be a good one to use intermittently to clear the buildup from all of my oil rich products.<br /><br />I was surprised and disappointed at the ingredients list when I looked. From a company called InstaNatural that boasts this as a holistic treatment I didn't expect to see so many chemicals. I would have preferred more familiar ingredients, and natural, obviously. Argan oil isn't even listed until the second to last ingredient. I like how it worked but I'm not sure how hard it would be on my hair if I used it regularly.<br /><br />I did receive my shampoo at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes.

AEU5ATUZSY22XUDTJHF755PMWFSQ,B013IRN9E0,5.0,"I've been dying my hair for almost 10 years and have done plenty of damage from the harsh chemicals and styling that I've put it through. It was starting to look really bad, lots of split ends and the hair itself was dull, frizzy, and lifeless. I started using argan oil masks to repair some of the damage I've done but the one I was using was more expensive then what I could afford to use regularly and was way too perfume-y for my taste. I have been trying Opulent's shampoo and conditioner lately and noticed how much better my hair was starting to look within the first week. That prompted me to look up their hair mask hoping that I could find it at a reasonable price. For this 8 ounce jar I'm paying less than half than I was with my previous product. This scent is so much better too. I use mine about once every two weeks to keep it looking healthy and strong. After shampooing I towel dry my hair and apply this throughout the body of my hair. I tend to apply much less to my roots because my hair gets greasy easily. After washing my body and shaving I rent the mask for my hair and holy cow! the difference can be felt right away. My hair is smooth and the brush slides right through it, I'm so impressed! I think I will be a lifelong customer of the Opulent line. The prices can't be beat and the results are to die for.

Using powder instead of a heavier concealer or foundation gives it a Much softer look and not like I've caked a bunch of crap onto my face. They blend together well and last all day. They include an ebook tutorial on contouring tips and tricks in an email after purchase and I found it to be extremely helpful. There are also about a billion and one videos in YouTube that show you clearly step by step. I am much more confident in my makeup application now and can't believe how easy it is with the right tools.

The hair extensions arrived as planned and they were attached to cardboard  the length of the hair to keep safe. They were then wrapped in a plastic bag to cover hair.  Upon opening the hair I did not smell any kind of smell to the hair.  The hair is soft to the touch and was the right color that I had ordered.  As with any extensions, you receive in the mail first thing you must do is use a hot iron and get the creases out from shipping.  When combing through the hair there were no tangles or missing hair.  I did have a little bit of shedding but that is to be expected and was not enough to have a second thought about.  The hair straightened great with no problems.  The hair is sewn onto a small comb metal clip and I did not see any loose clips.<br /><br />The quantity: The hair is what I expected it to be.  When I compared the two matching pieces together I did note that one has more hair than the matching piece. (You will see in pictures that I have included in this review).  However, this was on the two smallest extensions and not any other piece so for me that is not a big deal because I usually do not use those pieces.<br /><br />The quality: This is my second hair extension I have ever owned. The first one I bought I paid quite a bit of money for and the hair was not near as soft as this one from Grammy.  The quality of this hair is what I expected it to be but with softer hair. I am very pleased with the quality.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you have somewhat fuller hair than one package should give you the fullness you are seeking. With that being said, if your hair is really thin and you are seeking a full thick head of hair look than you might need to go with 2 packages. I would but then you run into how to clip all the pieces in your head. You must have hair to clip these on for them to stay in place.<br /><br />How I manage to be able to keep the extensions in my head all day all night and even sleep in for 2 nights if I want is by starting with clean dry straighten hair.  I then part my hair every spot that I will be clipping an extension to and I spray with a strong hair spray let dry and then I take a small man's comb and tease just at the base of my hair close to my scalp,  that gives the clips something to hold them in tightly no matter what I am doing.<br /><br />I hope that this review has helped in your buying decision.  I have posted pictures that I hope will allow for you to see each piece and the clipping device.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to post.

AFLCWNNFONDAF7WYBT6BHG22ITRA,B01M7UMAUG,5.0,"This teeth cleaning kit consisting of an ultrasound toothbrush and a “flosser” was fun to use. The rechargeable toothbrush is comfortable in the hand, requiring no actual conventional brushing. You just hold the toothbrush head over the tooth surface and let the ultrasonic waves do the work. It even gives warning beeps telling the user its time to move on to a new section of your mouth. The unit gradually builds up intensity over multiple sessions so new users can get used to the vibrations. One warning would be that if you have extensive repair work on your teeth (I had a chip filled on my front tooth) you may want to ask your dentist if its safe to use. If you use the brush correctly there is no problem, but if you accidently touch the hard plastic part of the brush head to a repaired tooth area it could cause damage. It has not happened to me yet, but I can see it happening.<br /><br />The flosser is more interesting. You fill a small resevoir on the flosser handle with water or mouthwash, press the flosser head between your teeth, and press a button. This sends a blast of water and air between your teeth. It doesn’t hurt. It seems to be effective and possibly more effective than a string type floss. It is definitely more comfortable than using a string flosser. Only the front spaces of your teeth need the treatment so accessing the inside of your teeth is not necessary.  It is a messy process if you do not have your mouth closed, as the water can spritz out of your mouth or make you drool, but with practice you should be able to minimize this (or use it in the shower).<br /><br />Battery life seems good so far. Both the flosser and toothbrush have their own charging stand. No plugs are used (except the AC wall plugs). You just drop the brush or flosser on a stand with a metal stud to begin the charging process. It can take several hours to reach full charge.<br /><br />I like using these the brush as it seems to be a bit more thorough than the average toothbrush. There are vibrating toothbrushes that act more like conventional toothbrushes available and you may like them just as much. The flosser, however, is truly unique, and if you are like me, a person who never flosses, you may find yourself actually enjoying the process.",False,1,0,1,2

I absolutely love the all natural, vegan and organic ingredients which are healthy for my face, the cream contains no toxins or pesticides. The cream is a thick white color with a very light citric scent. The cream is smooth and I have even seen a reduction in pores and forehead wrinkles in just one week!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this nutritious facial cream to improve the appearance of the skin by naturally renewing and regenerating skin cells.

I’ve tried just about everything I’ve ever ran across and now it was time to try this.  Hands down, this is the best can tan I’ve ever used.  I’m very thrilled about finding it!!  First off, the smell is very light, and nothing like the average self tanner.  I can smell most self tanners from a mile away and immediately recognize the smell, but NOT with this.  Also, let’s be honest, if you are seasoned at all with self tanning, you know self tanners make your armpits stink.  This is the only self tanner I’ve ever tried that doesn’t do that!!!  It has instant color, so you can see where all you’ve rubbed it in, rather than just guessing, in order to get that flawless tan we’re all looking for.  I personally use gloves underneath the mit that comes with it.  It works out wonderfully for me.  I did my research before purchasing this product, and I noticed bad reviews from a different seller with the same product, which most all were saying the exact same thing.....  the can is messy.  I’ve used this exact can 4 times by now, and I’ve never had a mess with it leaking until this last application.  If you experience this, here’s what you do!!  Mine would squirt all over the bathroom every time I attempted to spray more.  So, I wiped the can clean, effortlessly pulled the spray part off, then wiped it from underneath and also wiped on top of the can beneath where the spray top sets.  Wipe it completely dry!!  Put it back on, and carry on.  No more leaky issues whatsoever.  Very easy fix!!!  I can’t stand to read a negative review on a great product simply because the reviewer didn’t use their head and fix the problem.  Overall, this is by far a 5 star self tanner.  It doesn’t wash right down the drain after your first shower like other tanners seem to do.  The color is good, and it lasts!  I’ll be keeping this stuff in stock for sure.<br /><br />Also, I recommend rubbing in some moisturizer on the knees, heels, ankles, toes, elbows, and knuckles before using, and remember to go light on those areas to avoid orange patches.  After all, it’s still a self tanner!  And I purchased the back strap that helps you rub it in on your back, I recommend that too!!

And that's just because of the reviews here on Amazon. NOT!  I tried it and it worked EXACTLY as promised.  I watched in my makeup mirror as one eye bag disappeared before my eyes- fun!  It didn't leave a visible film but I have very light skin especially around my eyes, so this product might leave a chalky looking film on darker skin.  (They recommend mixing the product on the palm of your hand with your foundation 3:1 if that is an issue)<br /><br />Next: This is a TEMPORARY fix, just like makeup is.  It will only last 6-8 hrs depending on whether you sweat or have oily skin (both things will cause it to 'disappear').  Some bad reviews here reflect frustration over the bottle dispensor (you have to pump to prime it and must be careful not to overpump and waste product)- for me, maybe i got a new and improved bottle type, but I didn't encounter any problem whatsoever!<br /><br />As for price and quantity- yes, its expensive and yes, you'll be lucky if one bottle lasts you a month.  As for me, I don't intend on using it every single day unless I get hooked.  :0  Each bottle  has only 0.5 mls in it but you only need a teeny tiny drop each time.<br /><br />Lastly, i think your review will depend on your expectation.  My expectation was that the product would do what it said (temporarily de-puff some eye bags) and it does exactly that so how could I take any stars away from them?

Its a fun piece but here's something helpful I wanted to tell potential buyers: its got  'gold' or 'brass' looking metal accents, NOT silver. The picture on my computer makes it looks turquoise and silver AND gold, but you really have to know that the 'metal' looking accents will be  brass colored (bright yellow gold) with plastic turquoise.  So much so, that I wouldn't even pair it with sterling silver earrings.

AEQOKRNBQ6TVHJQBP6JHSBKCOWHA,B000YD8F9Q,5.0,"This is a clip-on human hair extension.  Here's why I love this product (and have bought several): 1) its human hair. I find that the synthetics cause me to itch where the ends touch skin when it swings/sways, but the human hair doesn't.  Plus its softer than synthetic.  2) you can wash, color and curl this.  I hot curl mine all the time (one of the 'con's' is that the curl doesn't hold from wearing to wearing).  If you had to color or wash this, you could. I've done both too!  But needs to be handled with great care!!! 3) its one unit, so its easy to apply. It has 4 clips across the back where you clip it up under your hair in back to gain a bit of length and alot of volume.  Keep in mind that this one is only 10 inches. That means that it will come just about to shoulder length (depending how you clip it in). It is NOT a long hair extension (look to 15-17 inches if you want long hair).  Other info/tips: The colors shown online are slightly off from what the piece will actually look like, but the descriptions are good. They will NOT take this back if you wear it, brush it out, etc. - so be sure to know the color you want before you order.  This company sells a wheel of colors for about $20 (you'd have to inquire directly with them for current price of their color wheel) and if you never ordered any from them before, I'd recommend getting that wheel to be sure of what you will get under each color number/name.  That being said, and you still want to chance ordering from the online descriptions, remember there will be some 'forgiveness' to the color you order because its clipped under your own hair and gets kind of mixed in.  I would recommend a shade darker than your own color, rather than lighter.  Lastly, if your hair is VERY, very thin...you may find that clipping in a full extension like this one is not practical (won't hold or blend well) and it may pull uncomfortably at your own hair and even cause breakage.  Along same line, I would not recommended this for people with bald patches.

I also wouldn't say that it tastes are smells like synthetic chemicals. These come pretty fresh sealed inside the packages and are at first really easy to peel and loosen the fibers. Once it dries out, you will need to employ the water-soaking method, which makes it simple enough. Just make sure it soaks for at least an hour for very easy handling. I've been using the same stick for months. It usually takes about a week or two for the end to get ratty enough to cut and start over again. I wouldn't say this stick eliminates flossing. It depends on the way your teeth are situated. I have some problem spots that I absolutely need to use floss for. That being said, I've noticed a significant reduction of plaque that is removed with a floss after brushing with a miswak (vs. after brushing with a good conventional toothbrush or even a sonicare toothbrush). In my personal experience, a miswak works better than a Sonicare. However, if you like the convenience of the Sonicare, stick to that. It depends on each person's habits and personality. You can damage your enamel with a Sonicare, so please be careful and follow the instructions carefully. You really don't have a problem with hurting gums or the enamel with a miswak. It is also the perfect travel toothbrush.<br /><br />Pros: Lasts a long time, is completely natural, no need for toothpaste, minimal flossing, travels easily, gentle on teeth and gums while getting into nooks and crannies better than a traditional western brush, dental study shows improvement of gingivitis with regular use of miswak.<br /><br />Cons: Awkward handling for back of teeth, must peel to get a new layer, some people don't like the taste, not easy for children to use.",True,1,0,1,2

The other company's set was my first venture into solid colognes.  I liked the variety it offered, and their colognes usually lasted most of the day.<br /><br />I expected the same from this set.<br /><br />I will admit, I liked variety that this offered, which is why I ordered it.  Now that I've had time to try out each one, here are my thoughts.  (Please note, cologne can smell different on each person, so what didn't work for me, may work for you.)<br /><br />Barista - I don't drink coffee, so the thought of smelling like coffee all day was not a selling point for me. I figured this would be my least favorite of the four.  When I opened the tin, it smelled like a 30-year-old motel lobby.  A powerful scent of cheap black coffee, with a hint of musty cigarettes and pleather couches.  I was not impressed.  Still, I put it on and the smell changed to more of a 1990s coffee shop.  Fortunately, the cocoa smell came forward more once it was on me, and the coffee was not as strong.  I don't hate it as much as I thought I would.  In fact, I kind of like how it smells on me.<br /><br />Woodland Ranger - My favorite out of the bunch.  While you may think it would make you smell like a Christmas tree, it's more of a clean outdoors scent.<br /><br />Snow Leopard - I love me some sandalwood, so this was the one I really bought the set for.  It says there is peppermint in it, but I can't smell it.  Also, I feel like the vanilla overpowers the sandalwood.  Not as good as I had hoped.  Not bad at all, just not what I expected.  (This one also seems to dissipate quicker than the others.)<br /><br />Uncle Jack - I smell the bourbon and a trace of tobacco, but once again, the vanilla is the stronger scent here.  It's definitely not a bad smell, probably my second favorite of the pack.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the headline, the colognes are just not as strong as I hoped for.

AGFS2GUS57XE24CHGAE4NQGRNQCQ,B077QTTH7Z,1.0,"It appears that, due to an observational study finding a small correlation between talc and cancer, many now believe that ‘science has prove talc bad‘.  This is due, primarily, to ubiquitous misunderstanding of what constitutes ’science’ and how enormous a difference there is between the reliability of actual science and observational studies—the former, after repeated and properly-designed experiments, provides a strong basis for causal inference, while observational studies provide little more than a reason to conduct an experiment.  Of course, we never hear about any actual experimental results, i.e. actual science, with things like this, because, either the observation result was merely promoted as a sensational headline and the people who conducted it know very well a minor correlation doesn’t even justify the time and expense of an experiment, or because experiments were conducted and didn’t produce the sensational result.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when media takes advantage of this widespread misunderstanding, good products are removed from shelves and good companies producing good products lose money.  Here, it appears the company chose to give in to the hysteria, which is a shame.  I suspect that, if their actual customers had much of a voice, they’d find out this was a bad decision.  They may find out anyway after people get tired of gelatinous gravy covering parts of their bodies after rubbing corn starch on them and sweating.",False,1,0,1,2

The only problem I see is the curly cream (step 5) , it has left white residue in his hair. I rub thru it very well to get it out.  Every child/person hair is different. Also, i have felt after using the curling cream (step 5) it dries out his hair after about an hour or so. So I just stopped using the cream and I feel it works better for us. It makes his hair so soft and it detangles it so well that I can comb thru his hair with my fingers. The oil makes it shine.

It’s almost impossible to get all the hairs into the covering, and not get them sticking to the outside. Also not sure why they have suction cups on the back side of them.

AE7LIASGQXOHAIUEGSN5GGIUEOTA,B08PF6CHBT,1.0,"At first, I wanted to give this a 4 star review. Initially, my biggest issue was the eyeliner applicator isn't the best. The brush itself is too long so it's hard to be precise and it got product all over my eyelashes. Personally, I would probably rarely if every use these as I don't wear eyeliner very often and never as thick as you have to apply it for these. Even if it would stick with a thinner line, the magnetic base of the eyelashes is pretty thick so it gives the impression of a thick eyeliner. I think you would have to draw the actual eyeliner thicker than the base so you can control the shape. But I recognize that this is more a makeup style preference than a default of the product.<br /><br />And then I went to remove the eyeliner. Holy mother of fire demons did that burn so bad! My eyes and skin can be a little sensitive so I'm always extremely careful with what I use to remove makeup and how I remove it.  I was being extra careful not to rub as I didn't want to risk getting in my eyes but it still hurt so much.  And it was not easy to get off! I always use waterproof mascara and eyeliner so I'm used to that but this was a whole other level of stubborn.  And it took a while for the pain to fade completely and my eyes were red for the rest of the day. So yeah, never putting that stuff back on.<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews, this doesn't seem to be a super common reaction but if you have sensitive skin or eyes, I would pass.",True,1,0,1,2

I appreciate that isn’t too thick and gloppy.<br /><br />The matte top coat is an odd duck. It’s not suuuuper-matte, but it works really well for my purposes. I have a crazy nail (after a little accident) with a thin vertical strip that constantly splits. If you imagine that would be painful, you would be correct, so I cover that nail in clear gel polish. The matte-ness is pretty close to the sheen of a natural nail so it’s not immediately obvious unless you look super close (and even then). So I don’t have to wear nail polish if I don’t want to, but if I do, I can just paint regular polish over this. And if you use a non-acetone polish remover, you can even switch shades without this coming off.<br /><br />The only reason I knock off a star is because the matte isn’t impervious, and it will pick up fabric dyes and other colorants fairly easily. Sometimes I’ll look down and notice that one nail is looking pretty grey (like the lenses on sunglasses), which is frustrating.<br /><br />Take off is not too bad. Those crazy clips that hold cotton pads to your fingertips and some acetone will make short work of this in about 15 minutes with no scratching that damages your nail plate.

It also is very calming and it is one of those minerals your body sucks up endlessly when you are under any kind of physical or mental stress, so it needs to be replaced for us to remain peaceful.<br />It is also said by detoxers that the sodium binds to toxins in your body to pull them out.  Of course I can't see that happening, but I do feel relief from pregnancy nausea, which is exacerbated by toxins like metals.<br />I can also report that when I soak in it I can scrape off a dark substance from my skin, which people report finding at the bottom of the tub after much more expensive and intensive detoxing.  This happens even when I go in clean, so I think it is coming from contaminants being pulled out rather than from the outside.  Who knows, but it feels good.<br />In the past I'd always thought of soaking in Epsom Salts as an old wives tale or something people used to do before they had real medical options.  After using it for a month or so, I can't believe everyone doesn't use it!  We've experiences marked relief from different types of pains and discomforts, and also think it speeds healing of open wounds by killing germs.

AEKMOOO4KWY3MG4M2CXWFQQ7Q5CA,B07T3Z58HL,4.0,"I've been diffusing essential oils for almost 30 years, ever since I purchased my first diffuser from Whole Foods back in the 1980s.  This diffuser is not representative of the latest generation of diffusers, but it fits nicely within the last generation.  The latest generation of diffusers are not waterless, cordless (rechargeable) and portable.  I have both types of diffusers in my home and much prefer the latest gen.<br /><br />This is a nice diffuser but is slightly more expensive than it should be, even with the ceramic appointments.  Like all water diffusers you put water in the chamber with a few drops of oil and let it go.  The light is nice but doesn't serve much purpose other than to remind you that the unit is on when you cannot see the cold steam.  I'm not a fan of the whole thing being lit because it does cause me to take a second look if my eyes slightly open while I'm sleeping.  I prefer a thin band of light. Of course on this unit you can turn the light off.<br /><br />It doesn't come with any oil which is actually good.  I find that when an oil is included in with a diffuser it's often the cheapest brand around and smells awful.  It might be enough to turn a newbie off of diffusing if they don't know that high quality oils exist.  I recommend Plant Therapy.<br /><br />I don't buy into the claim that this can be used as a humidifier because the output is just not strong enough.  After shut-off there is always water still left in the chamber.  This is not a good thing because if you want to change oils, you have to diffuse water with vinegar for a couple of run-throughs and then wipe down the inside. Of course there is nothing wrong with left over oil if you don't mind a blend, but sometimes I want one pure smell for a specific purpose.",False,1,1,0,2

I was hoping this product would be a suitable replacement but I'm not convinced so let me tell you about the photos.<br /><br />Each night I cleanse my face with Purity using Clarasonic's Uplift with the Revitalizing brush.  I follow this with micellar water (by Borghese) and then a serum and moisturizer.  The whole thing takes about 7 minutes (it's therapy, don't judge!).<br /><br />Upon waking, I swabbed my face with the micellar water and then took a picture of the cotton ball along with an untouched cotton ball for comparison.  And by the way for the uninitiated, micellar water is the best skincare product to come out since mascara was invented.  I was sure that my $349 Clarasonic erased all traces of dirt no matter the soap, but the micellar water never lies.<br /><br />On the second morning, first thing, I used the Clarasonic with the Radiance brush and three pumps of LaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser.  Two pumps did not create a bit of lather.

I tried using the flat top and it basically didn't do anything. I then tried using some of the side facets, and those were a little better but not by much. When dry, it took a fair amount of time and effort just to get it to blend or even to just apply and spread products. When damp, it moved the product around somewhat, but what it primarily did was absorb foundation and concealer. As for using the tip around the eye area, it was almost totally ineffective for me when it was dry; when damp, it felt almost too flimsy and squishy to do anything. Ultimately on both occasions, I had to put the sponge aside and just use my fingers or a super cheap wedge sponge from the drugstore to finish blending everything - both methods worked exceedingly better than this sponge, by the way.<br /><br />The one thing I appreciate about the sponge is that it's latex free, which is good for people like me who are allergic to seemingly everything.

I also don't have fingers. I lost them as a result of the injuries I sustained in a fire 16 years ago, which makes many things more of a challenge to me. And while many masks have very narrow elastic bands, that isn't always the case, and they must be pretty narrow to go into the notches on the extender.<br />If I could put the mask on at home, connect the elastics, and leave the mask on throughout my time away from home, that would be one thing. But it's not as easy and convenient as one might believe. If I put it on & simply take it down below my chin while en route to take a drink or something similar, the elastics go slack, & come off of either side of my mask.

AH2M4IUFXZZ2FYBUBMVICBD45PEA,B01LYCKRVC,1.0,"I wanted to try a synthetic fiber brush since it is impossible to dry your natural bristle brush sufficiently before packing it up on the day of travel. I was looking for a brush that I can use, shake out and pack within minutes. For use at home, I've had over the years a couple of natural badger brushes of varying quality, ranging from lower grade black only brushes to very fine silvertip.  So, trust me, I know how they feel.<br />This brush is for me virtually unusable.<br />When i try to lather up, i spray water and soap all over the bathroom. Try as i may, i couldn't prevent the spray. When these synthetic bristles are deflected even only a little, they spring back with a snap. It appears that the spring back force increases linearly with the amount of deflection. And all the fibers move almost in unison.<br /><br />This is very different in natural bristles where more force bends the hair further, but it isn't like a linear increase in force. During the lather, the bristles conform to your face and the circular action seems to gently bent the hairs in one or the other direction. The brush also spreads a bit, as fibers are pushed and bent a little. Once you lift the natural hair brush off your face, the bristles don't string back all at once. Some fibers may return to their approximate straight form, but the water and soap mixture will clump some of them together.<br /><br />I want to be clear that I don’t object to a different brush feel. As long as it does the job of lathering up and isn’t so coarse to feel like sandpaper, I’m fine. This synthetic fiber, on the other hand, are best compared to very playable, soft steel springs. Even when I tried to lather up very slowly and gingerly, each fiber literally snapped back to its original position. When you lift the brush off your face, all the bristles are back in place as if you just upacked the brush.<br /><br />In summary, this brush is far from coming close to the feel of badger bristles. I cant use it without spraying soap all over and I wish I could return it, but it appears I’m stuck with this thing.",True,1,0,1,2

You follow the three step process each night for three nights then only use a wet cloth to &quot;wash&quot; your face in the morning.<br /><br />Because this product makes great promises in a VERY short period of time, (and for $20 for a small amount of product, let's be honest!) and because I read reviews before I make purchases, and because I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for evaluation and my HONEST review, I have swallowed my pride (uhm, ego??!!??) and am not only going to share the process for this product but also, several of my &quot;naked face&quot; photos - before, during and after. This way you, my fellow Amazon buyer, may not only read my opinion BUT also decide for yourself how much difference this product made in at least this instance for me.<br /><br />BASICS- I am a woman, former Marine and (ugh!) a smoker. I will be turning 50 in June 2016 and although I have (so far) not found any actual wrinkles, other than a couple of minor horizontal lines on my forehead (thanks Dad &amp; grandma for the genetics!), I DID have fairly prominent acne from about 13 until after 30 (&amp; even a couple now!) leaving scars mostly on my cheeks and chin. I also was a serious sun worshipper, getting as brown as I possibly could, including tanning beds, outdoor activities, the Marine Corps and beach/pool lounging (anyone my age group remember baby oil and iodine? The worst thing you can do for your skin?? Yep! That was me!). It honestly is a miracle I don't look like a raisin. I do have discoloration &amp; brown patches all over my face. I stopped actively tanning just after my 40th birthday and now always wear sunscreen at least in my facial moisturizer. I do have a pretty good routine now because I want to try to preserve what I have and fight Mother Nature and gravity as much as possible, but my face needs some work.<br />ALL PHOTOS WERE TAKEN AT APPROX THE SAME TIME, IN THE SAME PLACE WITH CAMERA AT APPROX THE SAME DISTANCE FROM MY FACE (too close!!) AND IN THE SAME LIGHTING. NO FILTERS OR PHOTOSHOP USED.<br />BEFORE PICTURE- The &quot;before&quot; photo,<br />(hopefully these will show up in the proper order but in it I am wearing a grey t-shirt with black &quot;squares&quot; and a pony tail) shows the brown spots, scarring and general lack of &quot;glow&quot;. This was the night I began the process.<br /><br />THE PROCESS- Three steps/Three days<br />STEP ONE &quot;Gentle Prep Cleanser&quot;- The cleanser is a pearly white color (see photograph) The directions say it removes makeup, but as you can tell from my &quot;before&quot; pic, I did remove my makeup with a makeup remover cloth. I did this for two reason: 1- Because I didn't trust that the small amount of cleanser would actually remove makeup and clean enough and 2- Because I wanted naked skin to evaluate the cleanser itself.  I need not have worried. The cleanser cleans the skin and prepares it for the &quot;peel&quot; product at step two. The cleanser was very pleasant &quot;clean&quot; smelling and although it foamed very little (see photo of this step) it amazingly did a great job of further cleansing the skin and removing every trace of makeup (I know this because I used a white wash cloth to rinse my face - no I didn't photograph the dirty cloth!). My skin felt quite clean, but not &quot;squeaky/stripped&quot;, which is good, IMO.<br />STEP TWO- &quot;Non-Irritating Pro Peel&quot;.  This is a clear gel (see pic) which had a slight astringent smell to it. This is applied to the now clean and towel dries skin using fingertips. The directions say to keep it on for 5 minutes, or 2-3 for sensitive skin rinse them pat dry. I felt no tingling or burning at all, just the alcohol smell which is no big deal. This product does not dry like a mask and it doesn't turn white like some chemical peels are supposed to do. In fact, on the second night, I got distracted and left this on for over 10 minutes and still had no discomfort at all. When rinsing, be careful to avoid the eyes. After this step, my skin did feel kind of tight but not in an uncomfortable way at all!<br />STEP THREE- &quot;Radiance Renewing Deep Moisturizer&quot;- OH MY GOODNESS!!! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer!!!  I am going to try finding this alone for use as a night cream. As you can see from the photos of the &quot;dots&quot; of moisturizer on my face, there was not a lot of the cream in the packet &amp; I thought it would not be enough (I ALWAYS treat my neck all around and my chest area with the same process as my face!) but - again - I was wrong to be worried. This moisturizer feels so very good! I honestly wanted to use it all over. When I find the moisturizer alone, I will edit this review and add the name of the product!  This cream was the perfect way to end the process.<br /><br />All three steps took less than 15 minutes per night.<br /><br />The &quot;after&quot; photo was taken this morning because I wanted to allow the third night's process to fully work, so the lighting is a bit different. If anything, the daylight is harsher than the night photos and I took this picture even closer so I could really see.<br /><br />RESULTS- It is usually difficult to be objective about your own appearance. At least it is for me. I look at this face each day and see all my faults. However, I honestly can say that I have noticed smaller pore appearance and brighter, smoother skin. Putting on my makeup this morning was so much easier and to my great surprise, the makeup actually lasted well the entire day without the blotchy, tired appearance I usually find by the end of the day (the photo of me with makeup shows that my hair has definitely fallen and my eyes look tired but the foundation held up pretty well!). I did do an informal survey of a few friends, texting only the before and after photos for their candid opinions. The feedback was quite good!  I am an &quot;average looking&quot; woman, and this product did not make me suddenly a Cover Girl, but in my honest opinion, this product is a clear winner!  At the $19.99 price point, I am definitely going to be repeating this &quot;Three-Day Vacation&quot; again... Perhaps up to four times a year!<br /><br />I do enjoy testing products and sharing my experience, and hope the information I share helps other Amazon customers decide if a product is right for them, so if you find my review at all helpful (either good or bad for the product) please let me know by selecting &quot;yes&quot; in response to the question &quot;was this review helpful?&quot; At the bottom of this review.

AHUPKGKSH6TA2XJQTSPOERGJVUGQ,B019EVRO7W,2.0,"My once beautiful long hair is finally growing back in from chemotherapy for breast cancer. I had had it bonded by my hair salon about 6 months ago with Cinderella bonds that shed like a cat almost immediately and had hair that was split and damaged before I ever even washed it.<br /><br />I took a chance on ordering 2-18 inch packs of #613 and 2-16 inch packs of #613 of Sunny hair. The hair looked beautiful and was a perfect match for my own color, but there is no way of telling until it's been washed, conditioned and blown out over a few weeks to really know how it will hold up.<br /><br />My stylist, who specializes in hot fusion bonds, put in 1 pack of the 18 inch Sunny hair (50 U tips) and one pack of Cinderella hair (25 U tips) 5 days ago. I have very fine hair and a tiny head, so more would not have been possible (this amount also equals a full head of hair for me). We are experimenting to see which hair holds up better.<br /><br />After one wash, conditioning and blow dry yesterday, the high priced Cinderella hair was tangling in the middle, while the Sunny hair stayed tangle-fee, but did shed quite a bit. The Sunny hair has more weight to it than the much more expensive hair though and combed out better.<br /><br />One star off for how huge the actual keratin U-tip are and the shedding. My stylist tried to cut some of the tip off with great difficulty. This is an FYI for those with fine hair or those who want to be able to pull it back without the bond showing (the more expensive type has much smaller Keratin u-tips).<br /><br />I will update this review after 4 weeks in, but for now, I'd like to thank other reviewers for their input as it helped me choose Sunny hair. You were all correct in saying the hair is thicker than most online hair, even though each strand is a bit different in strand width, health and quality. As the industry is unregulated, it's hard to know what you're getting and with blonde hair, just how much processing went into coloring the hair (causing damage).<br /><br />If my Sunny hair holds up well, my stylist, who does at least 10 hot fusion bondings per month on clients, will be ordering directly from Sunny hair instead of the company that charges $125-$150 per pack. We are both hoping this is the case.<br /><br />I hope others will try this brand  and leave reviews on their experiences. Also, if this is your first time with bonds, please remember on length that it's not going from the top of your head. The lower layers will fall much longer - I'm 5'7 with a long neck and the 18 inch lower tiers fall just a few inches above my waist.<br /><br />UPDATE: please don't buy this hair if you value your natural hair.<br />It's impossible to remove the bonds without breaking your own hair.<br />It breaks, frizzes, knots up like crazy if in a warm climate.<br />I loved those first packs until summertime. Absolutely awful in heat and humidity. I couldn't get a brush through the hair. It would just snap off. The knots were horrific.

But because I have chronic pain, I've occasionally taken Epsom salt baths or bubble baths with a fantastic product called Muscle Soak. I found the salts were no longer really helping, so I thought I'd try these magnesium flakes. I take magnesium daily but a boost through the muscles that ache sounds great.<br /><br />I was floored at how quickly and completely they dissolved. The tub wasn't done filling and they were fully absorbed into the water. With salts, I have to get in and stir repeatedly to get the crystals to dissolve, often in water that's hotter than comfortable. So that was promising.<br /><br />I got in the tub and lay back, focused on the flower print on the wall....and was ready to get out in 15 minutes, but I wanted to give it the full 30. I wasn't magically relaxed or calmed by the bath as other reviewers are claiming. (You literally can't tell the flakes are there, as the water isn't salty like it is with Epsom salts.) I wasn't whisked away to a lush garden in my mind. I was just lying in a bathtub with pleasantly hot/warm water. While I was in the water and for up to an hour after I got out and showered, I felt a limited, temporary reduction in the tightness in my upper back. I put on a compression shirt to help things along but had 9/10 pain. When I can next score some Muscle Soak, I'll be going back to that. The bubbles are at least something to play with! And it is more effective on achy muscles.<br /><br />This is not a magic cure for stress or pain. I'll use it to soak my feet when they ache, but don't expect miracles.

It's hard to describe it because I've never smelled anything like it, even with my experience wearing a number of different fragrances through the years. It is the perfect blend of sweetness and masculinity, with subtle notes you'll catch whiffs of throughout the day that you didn't notice before. This is the kind of fragrance that will turn heads and get you a lot of compliments.. For me, this cologne is a standard to measure others by.

I was fortunate enough  - or so I thought -  to receive the [[ASIN:B001A0GDQE Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 Rechargeable Cordless Men's Shaving System]] last year and although it is not a comparison of equals, I now also have the Cool Skin 8040x. The 1090x is Philips/Norelco's flagship razor and this one is more of a middle of the road competitively priced product so any comparison is unfair...for the 1090x. For the last month, I've alternated between this razor and the 1090x, and my impression is without reservation, the 8040x delivers a superior cut. I've finally found a cordless that eliminates the need to keep some manual razors in reserve. Whomever led this product development team is making the top tier team look bad.<br /><br />Notwithstanding bells and whistles, the primary function of any razor is to offer a smooth, comfortable shave and this rechargeable gets the job done with aplomb, with or without utilization of the moisturizing system, whether employed as a wet or dry shaver. I'm not a real big fan of products that obligate additional expenditures for consumables like the Nivea Conditioner but I realize it is a nice feature for those who may need the conditioner to avoid skin irritation. I would recommend Nivea and Norelco team up to produce a fragrance free version as this product does conflict with other scents the consumer might use.  It is not my practice to use the conditioner every time I shave (every other day) but at my present rate, I would anticipate the initial conditioner supply will last at least six months.<br /><br />Cleaning the shaver is a snap. Just turn it on and wash the heads under hot running water. I wish the upscale model cleaned as efficiently, but then, as I facetiously stated in another review my primary use for that pricey unit is as a display item now.<br /><br />This razor's tracking system follows facial contours (head in my case) quite efficiently and does not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model. Additionally, the relatively compact size and shape is easier to manipulate. The 8040x also has a detachable trim head that can be used for close grooming and you can actually see what you're doing, another advantage over the premium model. Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.<br /><br />Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time. There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave. The charging stand has a reasonably small footprint although for convenience and my take on durability, the charging cord has to be unplugged but remain attached to the base. The inexpensive plastic retainer does not look as though it would withstand multiple rotations.  The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.<br /><br />Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I'll figure out how to securely pack it.",False,1,0,1,2

I thought it was gimmicky, but I am happy to be proven wrong.<br />This is so much easier to use than a flat iron.<br />I like that it has a digital LCD that shows you what temperature the brush is heating up to.  It gives the heat range that your hair styling should be at depending on thickness, etc. I set mine to 230, the hottest setting and it worked great for my thick, curly hair.<br />It heats up very quickly and the hand grip is comfortable. The cord rotates from the end and the grip on the back of the wand feels nice in the hand.<br />The rubbery nubs on the ends of the bristles offer some flexibility, but they are not as flexible as your hairbrush. They are also shorter, too.<br />The way that you do this is to start with clean, well brushed hair.  As the bristles are short, they will not detangle for you.  Have your hair prepped and ready.  If you use a smoothing serum, it would be perfect to add it before you start with this.<br />You simply brush it over your hair like you would a hairbrush. You can brush from underneath or on top to make sure that all the hair gets close to the heated plate of the brush.<br />You can spend more time on areas that you want straightened more but I found that my doing my hair in pieces (held up with an alligator clip) worked best for me.<br />In order to get to the roots at the scalp, it was very easy.  The brush is easy to angle towards the scalp and it gets about 1/2&#34; away from the scalp easily and starts straightening from there.<br />If you hair is damp, you will see some steam, but you'd expect that with a curling iron or flatiron, too.<br />This actually worked so well, my kids wanted to try it out and they loved it!<br />The only concern that I had was that if you hair is the type to come out when you brush it, it will come out when you use this, too.  The issue was removing the hair from the straightener.  It is HOT. I had to work quickly to sweep the excess hair from the brush to toss.  I will keep a wide tooth comb by this the next time I use it so I can run it over the bristles and remove the hair.<br />All in all: I give this a strong thumbs up!<br />I can't speak about the others on the market, but this one really does what it says it will do.  It is way better than a flat iron.  It covers more ground and feels more comfortable in the hand.  Its a natural movement to brush your hair and this is no different.<br />Excellent new beauty tool!

According to other reviewers, this doesn’t work well on acrylic or gel, which I’ve never used, so I thought I would give it a try on my natural nails. It was a good decision! It was also a good price, which was helpful since I have never used one and only heard of  “nail drills” when I searched for emery boards. I couldn’t figure out who would want to drill their nails! It sounded like a torture device! It turned out to be easy and painless.<br /><br />This is a great little manicure kit. I got it yesterday, charged it, and tried it today. It’s very easy to use. The instruction manual told me everything I needed to know to use it, including that it shuts off after two minutes, but you can simply turn it back on. For me, that’s not a problem. It is not faulty if it shuts off after two minutes. It’s supposed to do that. The device has two speeds, and it can reverse directions.<br /><br />I was concerned about vibration, but this didn’t vibrate noticeably to me. I really dislike using an emery board or other manual file because it feels uncomfortable. Filing with this little machine was so much better. It even has a light that shines on the work area. I also used the fine sander to smooth my nails, and then polish them. It was very easy, and the shine is amazing.<br /><br />It is rechargeable through USB. It comes with a cord that has a special end to plug into the manicure tool. The other end plugs into a USB wall charger which is not supplied. Again, for me that was not a problem as I have quite a few of those in the house.<br /><br />The kit comes with 1 grinder to file nails, 2 coarse sandpaper disks, 2 fine nail file boards (look similar to sandpaper disks, but much finer), and 2 EVA polish rollers. It also has a small bag of 10 extra assorted sticker, of the types I just mentioned. I am not sure how long each one lasts or how to order more if I need them. I couldn’t find the information in the Amazon description or in the manual that came with the kit. I’ll keep looking.<br /><br />I charged this in the bedroom overnight. When charging, the device has a light that flashes during charging, but stops flashing and remains on once charged. It’s pretty bright on a nightstand in a dark bedroom. I’ll probably charge it during the day! The first charge took about three hours.<br /><br />I hope this continues working as well as it did on my first try. As of now, I highly recommend this MiroPure kit. If that changes for any reason, I will update this post.",True,1,0,1,2

I’m glad the post office didn’t hold it or penalize Me at least.<br />First impression, love the heart. Very surprised that so much quality went into that and then the interior was just so cheap. Stacked nozzles that don’t stay together, a base that isn’t secure, and not a snug fit: one cat outburst and this things caput! Inside is a small container but it lasted a few hours more than I expected, although with the one hole, you can’t tell that you’re even diffusing anything unless you use a whole bottle of oil. It’s just too little being dispersed which is probably why it lasts longer. I like the concept, even my kids said it was cool, but def needs better construction to stabilize and make max use of the product.<br /><br />Update- I took the extenders off and just use the base and it disperses the smell much better. It also lasted about twelve hours which was surprising for such a small vessel. I’m still taking off a Star bc of the cheap base. For the heart quality, there needs to be something not only more aesthetically pleasing but safer.<br /><br />Update -3 weeks later and it no longer works.

Our littlest has been losing teeth left and right and is at the age where cleanings are too scary with her size. She would realistically need a cleaning much more often than yearly because the plaque builds up so fast.<br /><br />I bought this as a shot in the dark, as we have burned hundreds on every product known to man. I mixed the product parts together in the large bottle and sprayed 4 of our dogs’ teeth as instructed. After a SINGLE application, our girl with the bad teeth had a 25% reduction in plaque. Our other three had a reduction of 40%, 60%, and 90%. I am not joking - this stuff has carbolic acid in it and it WORKS. The two components mixed causes some type of fizzy reaction and really works between the plaque and teeth/gums and between teeth. I tasted it first myself to be sure it wouldn’t be traumatizing to our pups and it tastes like flavorless alcohol free mouthwash.<br /><br />Since, I continue to spray once or twice a day as I remember to and the plaque keeps disappearing. I did check with my dental tools to be sure it wasn’t just bleaching the plaque and it is not- it’s physically breaking off their teeth.

AFGO4GE3MIUENVXQGLZJM2TP7NEQ,B00183N9KQ,5.0,"I bought this giant pack after trying the 16oz tea tree oil cleansing conditioner and did some crazy calculation on the total/average cost of different ways of purchasing this really expensive hair cleansing product from multiple sources.<br /><br />Obviously, you can tell I'm quite convinced by this product, or else I wouldn't invest so much work/resources into getting it.  Because these things take a while to use, I will be updating my review as I finish each flavor included in this set.  I will not be using the Sweet Almond Mint, which is too oily for me and I'm sure you can find plenty of review on other package sizes.<br /><br />* Overall Impression *<br /><br />  1. Great reduction in hair loss<br />  2. Great increase in manageability<br />  3. Quite expensive for regular use<br /><br />A lot of people say ""this product changed my life!""  I don't want to exaggerate my excitement.  I think to be very fair this product made me discover something I never experienced with other commercial shampoos - ""near zero hair loss after wash"".<br /><br />I was a heavy shedder and I was used to losing a lot of hair everyday. With this product, I hardly lose any piece of hair at all during the day, with everything else being the same as my old-shampoo days.  I have to say I don't know how it will compare to shampoo during hair wash with an equal comparison (i.e. same washing technique).  WEN requires you to comb your hair during washing, which causes hair to shed when I wash my hair.  I did not comb my hair while I was using shampoos so I didn't know if combing in wash would be the same.  All else being the same, I lose about the same amount of hair during washing using shampoo or WEN.  The no hair loss during the day is amazing though.  I might have been allergic to the commercial shampoos and never knew it.  My hair now feels significantly thicker when putting into a pony tail.<br /><br />Another great discovery is that WEN makes my hair very smooth, light but not necessarily shiny.  It dries faster after wash. It also feels easier to manage - my hair now stays in the right shape - this is especially true after the 24 hours. My hair would have started to feel lumpy and oily if I had used shampoo, but WEN keeps my scalp evenly moist a little longer.  With these two improvements, I no longer use styling products or a blow dryer.<br /><br />* Impression on the Flavors I Have Tried *<br /><br />Tea Tree  5 of 5<br />Fig  5 of 5<br />Cucumber Aloe 3 of 5<br /><br />Very short, I would recommend people with oily/combination skin type stay away from the Cucumber Aloe.  Somehow it feels more water-based I had to use more to wash each time. At the same time, even though I make sure to wash it off completely, my scalp/hair started to feel oily sooner than when I use tea tree and fig versions.  Both Tea Tree and Fig are great for oily/combination type.  They make my hair feel clean and refreshed.  Fig makes my hair feels extra smooth and it is the richest/densest of the three.<br /><br />* How Long Does a 32oz Bottle Last? *<br /><br />When the WEN TV infomercial says the 12oz starter version is a ""30-day"" supply, you need to understand that it is for people with very short, thin, or little hair.  For someone like me with long, very thick Asian hair going to mid back, the 16oz tea tree bottle survived barely one month with washing at least every other day.<br /><br />Two other things to keep in mind:<br />The 32oz pump holds more than a 16oz pump, but less than twice the amount.<br />Each flavor varies in its moisture strength. As mentioned earlier, I had to use more Cucumber Aloe to achieve the same effect I can do with Tea Tree and Fig.<br /><br />I made a chart documenting my process of finishing up the 32oz Cucumber Aloe bottle. In total there were about 250 pumps, which lasted me 50 days with 30 washes, average 8 pumps per wash.<br /><br />* How Much Should You Use For Each Wash? *<br /><br />I definitely recommend strictly following the WEN instructions when you begin.  That is, use the large amount as instructed by WEN, follow the steps to rinse, massage, comb, leave in, rinse off.  This will help you see how the proper use can really change your hair as they've claimed.  However, this is an expensive product so we all want to use it efficiently.  Once you have formed the proper washing habit, start reducing the pump number little by little until you find your optimal dose.  I found my optimal to be about 1/2 of the recommended amount for my hair length.  Given the amount of hair I have, I'm sure many people can save more once you've started using it.<br /><br />On average I use:<br />Tea Tree 16oz - 15 pumps per wash (haven't started the 32oz bottle yet)<br />Cucumber Aloe 32oz - 8-9 pumps per wash<br />Fig 32oz - 7 pumps per wash",True,1,0,1,2

I loved the one I had of the other brand, but the sponge blender kind of burned when I used it. It was just too rough for the eye area (mine, anyway).<br /><br />At first I thought this set was just one eyeshadow stick and I was trying to figure out how to choose which color or purple I wanted. Then I saw that it was SIX STICKS and each color had its own blender brush. OMG! This makes it an amazing deal! There's not a single shade of these that I won't wear and I usually wear about 3 colors from the set at once.<br /><br />These colors are really pretty as well as very soft and flattering. I used the video to show the colors on my light skin since a lot of times I'm wondering how something will look on me. These are frosty shades of purple, meaning they are sparkly. A lot of them are kind of a brownish purple, which I was happy to see.<br /><br />Each end has a cap. The brush end is where you twist to raise and lower the stick. The brush is very soft, like a regular makeup brush. You can put the cap from the colored end over the brush cap and it stays on. Totally handy!<br /><br />I was wish each cap on the color end was the color of the eyeshadow, but then I realized the color is written on the side in the color of the shade. Now I can find the one I want much faster. The cream eyeshadow glides on wonderfully without dragging your eyelid. It blends easily and looks so nice. If you're looking for waterproof all-day color, this isn't it. Otherwise, this is a great set that you'll have so much fun with. I prefer cream makeup now that I""m older and these are probably the best eyeshadow sticks I've had.<br /><br />The best things about these sticks (aside from the gorgeous purple colors)? That each stick has it's own blending brush. You don't have to worry about mixing colors on your brush or even using your own brushes. The brush on the end is what sold me and I'm just so thrilled they are as soft as they are. Couldn't be happier.<br /><br />This is the best little set and I'll buy it again when I use it up. I'd love it if they came out with a burgundy set and I'd also buy a smoky set (hint, hint, hint). A smoky set would be wow.

That's my personal feelings on the matter.<br /><br />The cream itself is very rich and smooth without a chemical smell, more like your typical face cream.<br />I did the back of my hand test first to check for a reaction. There was none, so the next morning I applied the cream to one half of my face for the &#34;face&#34; test.<br />This cream is VERY rich. Just lightly tap your fingers on the open jar, and you'll get just the right amount. A little goes a long way.<br />I applied it to my forehead, cheek and neck. It absorbed fairly quickly with no greasy residue.<br />DId it pass the no breakout, no hives test? Yes it did, and my skin felt softer throughout the day without drying out or leaving any dry patches.<br />Overall, it's a good, luxurious feeling lotion, but with that Palm Oil in there, i'm not 100% on board, so, I'm really at 3.75 stars on this product<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount for my honest review.",False,1,0,1,2

I used [[ASIN:B004RRGXKI Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 4 Count]] in conjecture with this cleansing oil. This oil is a great, basic, no frills cleanser. I usually needed 2-3 pumps because my dry skin would soak up the oil and I needed extra to actually cleanse. It has a flora scent which while I didn't feel over powered by, I didn't love either. The oil does a great job taking off daily sunblock and makeup. I did not use it to take off eye makeup but micellar water instead because I found it did not take off mascara well at all.<br /><br />I never broke out when using it and always felt clean after washing with it.

Of course, our feet play an important role throughout our lives as they have to bear our full weight: and each foot has 26 bones, 22 joints and 107 ligaments that may all need care. Beurer North America says that this foot bath will be a simple and convenient solution for sore and tired feet. The bath has three setting functions (water heating, vibration and bubble massage), an  integrated water heater. The infrared light points will support the soothing effect of the foot massage. The three exchangeable pedicure tip can deliver a cleansing foot care treatment. The massage-assisted foot bed,  Beurer states, will stimulate the feet; the detachable roller attachments will give a soothing foot reflexology massage; the double-walled housing ensures better thermal insulation. It includes a removable splash protection guard, convenient draining outlet, infrared light points to support the soothing effect of the foot massage.<br /><br />I expect Beurer North America is a branch of a German company, and I am as awed by German engineering and technology as anyone else. But Beurer’s claims that this device can deliver a professional quality luxury spa experience are, frankly, silly. The item is more of a novelty  than anything else.  To begin with, I know nothing about German bathrooms, but in this country, any electrical outlets in bathrooms seem inevitably to be near the sink. The  cord provided is not  long enough to allow the item’s use in the tub without an extension cord, which, considering the well-known risks of mixing electricity and water,  adds an unnecessary element of risk.  So you will probably end up sitting on the toilet seat, or may have to bring in a chair. And the gadget is messy; you’d better put it on a towel. That being said, it did make my feet feel marginally better after a long tough day. Will you find it useful?  That depends on how much you’re willing to spend on it, and whether you have room for one more bathroom gadget of limited utility.",False,1,1,1,3

I long since stopped shaving my underarms because the stubble grows in faster than a man's 5 o'clock shadow and is painful and this kind of hair removal solves that problem. As far as pain goes it's not so much that I'm used to it as it is that hairs have different growth speeds and once you're on a roll using it regularly you don't have that many coming out at a time and it's less painful for that reason. I was excited to see this product come out because it had some great features others have not had before, such as a light to see hard to view areas better and a detachable brush for exfoliation, as well as features some others have but I have not had before like the ability to use it without the cord and the ability to use it wet.  I just cannot understand why it only comes in one speed when on. I found that it broke rather than removed hair at the fast speed, which can lead to some painful ingrown hairs. Slower speeds give a device time to actually get a good hold lower down on the hair and remove it. I think there is a perception that it's like ripping off a band-aid and that it should be done quickly to be less painful, but I find it less painful and more thorough with a slower speed.

If you have long hair and a lot of it, one pack will definitely not be enough, as is the case for me.<br />I was confused as to how to put them on. However, luckily for me, my sister knew how to do it since she had seen someone else try out this same style of curlers, but from another brand. Since she knew how to apply them, I told her to try them out for me and let me know, because I knew I'd end up frustrated.<br />Here's her take on them: They are tricky to apply at first and it takes a while to apply them, so make sure you have something else to keep you busy while you do this. However, once you know what you are doing, they're no longer tricky, but they are still time consuming. It takes time to section out the hair, put the curler in, roll it up, and repeat. Also, it is best if you do this at night if you are someone who has a sensitive head and is prone to headaches from wearing certain hairstyles. I put these on at around 3 p.m. and wore them for the rest of the day. After applying them, I was lounging around and watching a movie. Since I was laying down, I didn't notice any discomfort. However, once I was sitting up, it wasn't long before I felt a tension headache coming on. So, I would say that these are not good for someone who is sensitive to pressure from hairstyles. They don't look heavy, but there is a certain weight to having your hair ""pulled"" into the curler which can cause discomfort. I decided to sleep with them on, and was able to sleep just fine, since I didn't have any of the curlers directly on the back of my head. Upon taking them out, I had some nice curls, but I also had some wonky ones. I don't know the exact cause of that (rolled wrong, hair not pulled in correctly, moved during sleep, etc). However, I still liked the results and the curls held up for me, despite not having using any curling cream, gel, or anything.<br />All in all, they're a good product to try out and they allow you to get some curls without heat styling, but they can be tricky to use.",False,1,1,1,3

In his review, Reuben gives good tips on the use of this trimmer: take your time when you use it and clean it out after every use. The first results in even trimming; the second allows the vacuum to work best. Yes, a few hairs will show up in the sink, but with one swipe with a damp tissue they're gone. The adjustable comb trims beard, mustache, goatee, etc., to any length a user might want. In addition to the trimmer, the mustache and sideburn clipper gives a precise and neat edge; to use it, just remove the comb.<br /><br />Taking the T770 apart to clean the blades is easy; getting it back together properly requires careful assembly in good lighting and some patience. I wish Norelco would simplify the re-assembly mechanisms and process. But even that, since I have now mastered it, does not truly lessen my liking of this product.

I'm not sure if it's acting as some kind of barrier for my skin, or it's simply a coincidence.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty drying, so if you have normally dry skin I'd recommend massively moisturizing at least a half hour before using this. Apply with a cotton ball or cotton round, let it dry (your skin will tighten like you're using a face mask), and then apply your makeup as normal. I'd also recommend a setting spray afterward just for some extra protection.<br /><br />Because it's so drying, it's not something I'd recommend for every day wear.

I opened the box up, slide the brush out and plugged it in. It turns on by pressing and holding the power button. It automatically heats to 180 degrees Celsius. This can be controlled with the + and - buttons in increments of 5 degrees. On my first try I let it heat to the 180 degree mark. It blinks with its current temperature as it heats until it reaches temperature. I brushed out my hair to make sure it was free of knots (I have read other reviews where these types of straighteners do not work well in removing knots, they just get caught). I clipped up the top layer of my hair and began brushing. Within a pass or two through each section, my hair was straightened and the summertime frizz was removed. I repeated this process on the top layer. The entire process took less than 5 minutes. The low heat worked well and cooled quickly. I was able to clip my hair back to continue applying my makeup without developing a mark in my hair. It also did not leave my hair feeling dry or damaged like my flat iron typically does. It was such a pleasant change of pace to achieve the look I wanted without feeling like I did additional damage to my hair.<br /><br />We have recently had 90 degree days with 80-100% humidity. The Professional Hair Straightener Brush Best for Beauty 40W Digital Electric Straightening Comb by Magnifeko cut right through the frizz that I had developed throughout the day and left me looking primped and ready for a dinner date with my husband in seconds. I have generally straight hair, but it tends to get frizzy and wavy especially in high humidity or after working out. The Professional Hair Straightener Brush Best for Beauty 40W Digital Electric Straightening Comb by Magnifeko will be a great tool to bring on my upcoming vacation to the Caribbean!

One model put hers on, claiming that it was easy after you get the hang of it... but even her lashes did not fit next to her eyelid.  There was a space of about 1/16 of an inch.  She said that they look really good &#34;from a distance&#34;.  Hey Hey Hey... from a distance???  You've got to be kidding.  How many of us want to stay across the room to look good??<br /><br />In addition, I really don't know whose eyes they are made for.  These lashes do not follow the contour of anyone's eyes who I know.  Who has straight eyelids???  These lashes look like wings on your eyes.

The discount I get does not influence my feedback or review.<br /><br />My personal criteria for products:<br /><br />• 1 star (I do not like this item or product).  I feel it's a waste of money. Would never use it again. Would not recommend. Either throw away or return it.<br /><br />• 2 star (Not a big fan): Would not purchase again nor share it with my friends, but may still have at least 1 positive thing about it.<br /><br />• 3 star (It’s Fair): Product has both positives and negatives, and I may or may not continue using it. It might be a better item for another person.  If I think of who may like it better I will likely write about who I think it would work for.<br /><br />• 4 star (Pretty, pretty, pretty good – to quote Larry David): Item is accurately described. May have 1 or 2 things I might potentially change, but not a deal breaker. Would recommend it to friends and family.<br /><br />• 5 star (It is perfect and I LOVE it!) Practically perfect. Amazing quality and a must have. It means I’m “Over the Moon” with it and would not only recommend, but would purchase for others and continue to purchase for myself.",False,1,0,1,2

There were seams of jagged plastic that my hair got tangled in. The “hands” didn’t line up perfectly, so there were weird gaps in the holes where the air came out, which my hair got stuck in and ended up losing a few strands. I then got my nail file and used the coarse grit side that I never use on my nails to “sand down” the rough edges from the seam, and around the holes. I had to keep sanding because I’d test it, feel the area that snags, and then file again. By the time I finished, the whole thing was sanded down and looking awful. Can’t return it now! I used it once it wasn’t snagging all my hair and breaking it off, and it did work. Heat was coming out of the “tips of the fingers” and my roots were dried, and the rest of my hair could air dry in all its undisturbed curl pattern glory. But it was still kind of snaggy and I was just so over sanding this thing as it took way longer than it should have, which honestly, it should have not had to be done at all! If I had to do it all over again, it’d just buy the bright green name brand one that was double (maybe more?) the cost of this, and not waste time screwing around with sanding this thing.",True,1,1,1,3

I took a before picture of my eye before cleaning and with my normal makeup. I then took a picture of my eyes with no makeup. The directions are super simple. and are listed in the box as well as on a paper provided. You can curl or brush your eyelashes as normal before applying. I try to brush them first to help separate the lashes and make for a more natural look. So, I took the first tube(aptly marked Step 1 and 3) and applied to my lashes. I then took the 2nd tube( also marked Step 2) and applied the dry fibers to my lashes. Then back to the 1st tube and apply again. Now according to the directions you can do this several times. I was so impressed after just one application I stopped. Seriously impressed! First, it doesn't LOOK fake. I hate clumped up lashes. Second, They feel weightless. I can't tell that I have mascara on.That in itself is amazing. It added length and color without making the lashes feel like I have anything on them at all.  I asked my husband to see if he noticed and got a &quot;Wow! That's impressive&quot; so yeah, definitely 2 thumbs up here.<br />I would recommend these to anyone who likes to lengthen and darken their lashes. I have used a variety of mascara- from store brand to Sephora and Ulta.

I know, more information than you wanted, but it's relevant.<br /><br />This razor is the only one I have ever had that works for everything. Oh, I had some really nasty razor burn before I got the hang of it, but since then, it's been great! No cleaning and maintaining 2 razors any more.<br /><br />I have found with this razor, that putting pressure on it is a big no-no. If I do that, it will tear up my skin big time. I have to just sort of guide/glide it over the area, no pressure on it, and it does a beautiful job without the razor burn.

There is no indicator system on this razor, and when it needs charged, it just quits. If you keep playing with the on/off button, it will run for 2 or 3 more minutes, but that's it.

Unlike other gel polish brands this one gives you two ways of easily identifying the colors. Each bottle has a clear opening in the front of the bottle as well as a color sticker on top. Those are very useful but some colors are still hard to make out so I had to open them to get a better look.<br />I applied the base coat and found that it was a bit thicker than expected. I have used some other brands of gel base coats and the consistency is generally thinner. Most of the polishes are light but not to the point of being watery. It's the same consistency as non gel polishes which I prefer. However, some of the glittered polishes that have confetti included are pretty thick and almost chunky. I'm not sure that it will last long based off the consistency at first use. I hope they do last because those are some of the prettiest colors. I love that unlike other brands of gel polishes that I've used, this brand's glitter polishes are not opaque. It's both shiny and the color is dense. I put on the color A708 first cured it then topped it with A707 while leaving some of the color A708 visible. I then layered it with the color A712 on a diagonal so that some of the color A708 would still be visible. I know the colors are hard to make out from the photo. I realized after the fact that I probably should've started with the color A707 or A712 first. I used number A707 and A708 alternating on the remaining toes. I finished it by putting a gloss top coat and cured it with the UV light. I set it to 60 seconds for three rounds just to make sure the polish dried fully. It has been two days and so far so good. The photo of my toenails were taken on day two.<br />Overall, I love the color selections. They're very pretty hence why I chose to use 3 colors at once. I can't wait to use the rest of the colors. I really love this set. I like to paint my toes colors that are compatible with the current season so these color selections are perfect for my seasonal needs. I wish the bottle sizes were a bit larger but I guess they make up for that by offering a lot of color selections. Also, you don't need to cake on the polish. A little goes a long way. The only drawback is that the base coat seemed a bit too thick so it may not last, but it could be an isolated case with this set. It's not a deal breaker though, which is why I'm still giving it 5 stars. Plus you can always buy another base coat.",False,1,1,1,3

You also receive two jewel packs and the crochet needle. The back and sides of my head are shaved so I only needed about 2 packs, but not the full 2 packs. I only needed the 2 full packs because I had to redo a couple because the hair either got too frizzy or it wasn't wide enough to thread and hold the hair through. The hair is okay but I'm not sure if I'd use it again. It'd be more likely to do so if the hair was made more hollow in the center to make it easier to thread my hair through. Also, I noticed in dim lighting that the base of the hair looks reddish instead of looking dark brown. It got the job done but I'm not sure how long it'll last.

The tubes are small so I'm not sure how many uses you'll get out of it. I think you'll get about 2 full uses per tube maybe 3. I had a hard time with this poly gel. I squeezed a small amount onto the nail former and smoothed it out evenly. I put a thin layer of base coat on my nail and cured it. Then I put the nail former filled with the poly gel onto my nail but it wouldn't stay in place. The former kept lifting from my nail. I tried putting more and putting less to see if it'll help the former stay in place but it didn't work. I cured it for 120 seconds twice and even then the center of my nail where the former lifted from didn't turn solid. I even have a couple bubble pockets. Also while curing, the poly gel flowed to the right side of the former and created a thick dried buildup underneath the nail. I think the shape of the former is what caused this and because the former needs to be lighter. I came to this conclusion because I have used another poly gel brand where the former was feather light and less curvy and was able to cure the gel completely and the former stayed in place until cured. I didn't have any buildup underneath my nail either and got it on the first try. Otherwise, the poly gel was very easy to shape after being cured. I used the clear and I love how natural it looks but it feels like I have an acrylic nail. I might use it in combination with the nail extention in the future. Hopefully that will stop the buildup from happening. It also comes with a free gift of glitter. Overall, the set it okay. May be better suited for more advanced users.",False,1,1,1,3

She is very positive in her impression, saying that of all the products she has tried, this one seems to have a reliable effect in reduction of micro wrinkles and skin moisturizing. It goes on light and leaves no oily residue.<br /><br />The big issue is that the product is easily 8 times the price of other squalane oils. Given that the single ingredient listed is the oil you have to wonder if the oil is cold pressed by seraphim from plants tended by nymphs.

So when a 'stache wax or grooming product comes available on Vine I'll usually request it if it's anything in the neighborhood of what I usually like.<br /><br />I like firm or strong hold waxes with significant tackiness. I won't even consider a wax unless it either states a strong hold or a tacky hold or both. As a reference my other favorite common varieties of moustache wax include (in order of preference descending):<br />Firehouse Moustache Wax - Tacky (Wacky Tacky)<br />The Vintage Grooming Company - Death Grip<br />Can You Handlebar - Primary<br /><br />All of these are either exceptionally tacky or very strong in hold or both. I have tried many other waxes by various brands over the last several years but the ones above are my favorites and the ones that I feel are most worth mentioning in comparison to this product.<br /><br />I would rate this wax as slightly less tacky than the Firehouse Moustache wax Tacky and slightly less stiffness than the Can You Handlebar Primary wax. Death Grip has it's own unique and weird properties (and I don't love the way it smells) so it is hard to direct compare :-)<br /><br />As far as my general ranking I'd put this solidly in the top 5 waxes I've ever tried though, probably just under the three above and maaaybe 5th place after maybe Fisticuffs Strong Hold (which also has some pine resin for stickiness).<br /><br />Unscented is good! Nothing worse than a cloying scent right up under your nose holes all day long!<br /><br />Anyway, it has a strong hold for shaping if you like a strong curl as I do, combined with a tacky hold if you get a lot of stray and fly away hairs as I do.

Like, white white.My arms and face generally see a little sun in the summer and darken slightly, but I take care to wear SPF so I never see much change. My legs, on the other hand, are a problem. White. Blinding.Horrifying. I've tried many self tanning products in the past, mostly lotions and foams. They all worked okay, usually with streaking and the dreaded orange tone, but what is a girl to expect?<br />I can tell you now, there's more out there for us than orange legs. This yea is the first in 3 or 4 that I have actually chosen to wear shorts. I figured, I'm too old to care what people think about my stretch marks, white legs, weird veins. So I bought a Loreal spray bronzer a few weeks ago. I was left with horribly streaky legs that I had no choice but to cover up. I can deal with my own legs, but streaked legs? I couldn't do it. I found this Bronze Doll spray and I decided to give it a try. I've never used a mitt before and I was curious.<br />I waited until the streaking from the last tanner I tried was completely gone before using this, because I wanted to give it a fair shot. Immedietely upon spraying the product into the mitt and rubbing it on my legs, they were transformed. I can't lie, it looked like I was spreading paint on my chunky white calves. It was almost a purple color. I was shocked, but I kept going. I rubbed the product onto both legs, being as careful as I could. It had a really pleasant scent, almost tropical, but it went away when the product dried. Dry time was about a minute- but I didn't put my shorts on for a few minutes after that. I didn't notice any transfer whatsoever, either on my clothing or my white bed sheets. By the time I went to bed, the color had settled to a nice bronze. Not too dark, but very noticeable. My legs ended up a little splotchy, but I know that it was due to user error. I woke up with nicely tanned legs, for the first time in years.<br />Then I took a shower. As soon as the water hit my legs, it turned brown. I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting that. I rubbed my legs a little and no additional product seemed to come off. When I got out of the shower, I saw that the color had been reduced by about half, but was still obvious on my skin.I will reapply tonight to help with some of my mistakes from yesterday. This is a dark enough product that I think I can only use it 3 times a week if I want to look normal, and I pretty much do. I love the way it makes my skin look.

I was able to purchase this product at a reduced cost in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own. When I repurchase the product, I will happily do so at full cost.",False,1,1,1,3

No more Peepee Doll for Dennis.  Grab it, George!  Both arms, dear, hold on with both arms.  Let go of it, Dennis.  Let go.  Let go.  Let your father have the Peepee Doll.  Good...okay.  Are we all calm now?  Dennis?  All right, that's good.<br /><br />Now, let's see, what did old--Dennis!  Put down the tree!  Dennis, you put down that Christmas tree this instant!  Put it down!  Don't you even think about putting that in the fire, Dennis.  George!  George, give Dennis back the Peepee Doll!  Put down the tree, Dennis, and Daddy will give you the Peepee Doll.  There we go.

Now, let's see what Kris Kringle--Dennis, don't look at your Aunt Jeanette like that.  Staring is very rude, Dennis.  Dennis, sit down!  No licking, Dennis!  We don't lick our guests!  Don't--Put Jeanette down, Dennis!  Put Aunt Jeanette down this instant!  George, get the shot!  Dennis, no licking!  Get the shot, George! Go limp, Jeanette!  Go limp!  We don't lick guests, Dennis!

It's very smooth, and silky going on. Leaves, a very mellow, yet bright look on your eyes, which looks really pretty alone! Eyeshadow go's on smoothly over it, and I do think it helps it pop the color out. It's not tacky on your eyes like some. I would say it's better by itself, and to help making the application of eyeshadow easier, and help's shadow stand out. It does dry quick. The con's are, I can't really tell a difference in my eye makeup, or shadow lasting longer. &, I do still wish it came with more, because it doesn't last long at all.

I wrote a review for the larger palette organizer that has more details if u want to check it out.<br />  I actually got this for $15, which is an amazing price!! If you havent checked out their website, definitely do! I signed up for their email newsletter and they frequently send me discount codes which is awesome. Also, if you go to their website, and then click on their link to follow them on Instagram or Facebook they give a code for 20% off! Which is how I got this for an amazing price!

This keeps them all in one place, and pretty compact (for 10 palettes) It is sturdy acrylic, that will probably last forever. It fits the Large Z Palette perfectly and the MAC Pro Palettes (older slim version.) I wish it were about an inch wider so I could put my Viseart palettes together, but overall I am very happy. I read on the Alegory website they were coming out with an oversized &amp; small palette organizer, so those might be worth picking up also to organize by size better. I love to look at pics to see what will fit into certain organizers, so I included a pic of mine. In case it is hard to tell, these are what palettes that are in it: (Front to Back) 1.Viseart, 2.

AGD7KYQQR6KCNOPTJQUIU6TVPLRQ,B07HGPF98J,3.0,I want to give my honest opinion on this Hair the reason I gave it three stars was because the smell I ordered three bundles and the smell was very strong and really hard to get rid of.<br />My first impression upon opening the hair was that it was very soft and very wavy looks exactly like the pictures however it seems to me that there is something on the hair making it have that exact pattern for every bundle. I’ve been buying here over 20 years and I’ve bought a very expensive top quality hair for a 19 1/2 of those 20 years. I was seeking hair that is cheaper because I’m tired of spending so much money on hand. For the money of this hair it’s really good I washed the three<br /> Bundles and felt that they were very soft very slick when washing no shedding while washing but the pattern was different after I washed the hair which is fine for me in order to get the curl pattern back I had to use promax gel and leave in moisturizer. As far as tangling yes there is tangling all hair tangles. I don’t care what hair you have it is going to tangle it is not excessive tingling that I’ve experience with this hair !It’s just normal tangling because I sleep on it without braiding it up so no Matting  and no shedding! That is the most important thing to me is that hair doesn’t matter and shit I’ve had bad experiences the last few months with chatting with other hair so I’m happy to find this I do like the hair I will order it again for the price you really can’t beat it all though let me add I did sell the wefts because I’m paranoid! The hair is a finer texture like baby fine hair so when it’s not put into the wet looks state it may look frizzy. Overall I agree with most of the reviews on here that the hair is nice soft and doesn’t shit doesn’t tangle as much.I have only had the hair in two weeks so I plan to do an update later on,True,1,1,1,3

But, I figured I could make it even healthier by using the No. 0 and No. 3 method. The first time I did it I didn't notice anything, at all. So I thought I'd try it again. Nothing. A few weeks later (considering the availability of the trial sizes) I gave 0 and 3 another try. That time my hair was dry, rough, and flyaway. Anything but sleek and well-bonded. As for the No. 8 mask, again, nothing outstanding. The take-away: I love Olaplex shampoo, both the regular and their purple for blondes shampoo.

AGF36YVZJS4PZSKVEV3QEY4IR3CQ,B07T3SZPDT,2.0,"This company gives a free bob wig if you give a 5 star review.  I shop online alot and rely on reviews for help so I'm not going that route.  I'll give a real review instead.<br /> This is not a terrible wig but for the price point I've had much better.  Hair is beautiful but sheds.  All wigs shed, yes, but too much shedding for the price point.  I'm used to kinky straight or italian yaki hair that allows for all styles but this wig does not hold a curl from a hot tool very well.  Great if you want to just wear it in its natural state or have time for no heat options but for me, that's a deal breaker as part of the reason I love this texture is for all the styling options.  The hair is not as thick, root to ends and before I cowshed this unit, I ended up having to cut about 2 inches from it because the ends were so scraggly.  I'm harder on this texture when reviewing as this is my go to texture and I've purchased this texture from no less than 10 vendors over the past few years so my knowledge on what it should be like makes me that way.<br />With that in mind, I would not purchase this item again.  At this price point the quality should be better and the hair more versatile.  On the plus side, the preplucking was decent, though I had to help it out a bit.  Nots are not bleached but are very small in the front so I was able to clear that up fairly easily.  I know people care about the wig smells so I will say it smelled wiggy but not stinky out of the box.  Hair is soft and flows nice as well.  I'd post pics but they'd be misleading as, since I'm so used to this texture, I've hooked this unit up but, for newbies this wig is more work that its worth- again, price point considered.  You can get better quality with less work required elsewhere.  Again, this is an honest review.  Even though the 5 star review tactics turned me off, I can say that it's possible I got a bad unit and this is not the norm but I given I've had cheaper units with the same issues, I think this is just the product.

AFVQ7ISUMJ2VCI7MD4SBIYSKBUDQ,B00011JN5G,4.0,"I have used this to treat some rogue hairs on my face and have been successful. The hairs are on my cheek bones above my beard line, nose tip, between my eyebrows and a single one on my ear. Many of them have not grown back in a month after first treatment. I treat every 1-2 weeks. Whatever does come back I have treated again and there is less to treat each time.<br /><br />It's more tedious than IPL for sure, but the success rate per treated hair seems good. Also you can be very precise with this.<br /><br />My technique is:<br />Grind some salt in a mortar and pestle to get a fine salt powder, put it in a small container with filtered water. Get a small container and put rubbing alcohol in it. For the container I just use a two sided measuring spoon from my kitchen. Maybe an old contact lense case would work good too, just don't use it for contacts after. Clean my face, then use my fingers to spread rubbing alcohol on the follicles I'm going to treat. Dip and wisk the end of the electrolysis pen in the rubbing alcohol to clean it. Get in front of a well lit mirror and table. Make sure the tip of the electrode is perfectly straight and fully extended - - mine was a little curved at the end and needed straightening. Dip into the salt water solution the index finger that is on the hand that will hold the pen. Hold the pen on the plastic parts with your other fingers. Fully insert the electrode into the follicle to treat. Touch your salty index finger on the metal band to electrify the electrode. You will hear a buzzing for a few seconds, then a pause, then buzzing again. The pause means treatment for that follicle is done and you can move on to the next. Though for good measure sometimes I prolonged the treatment of each follicle for an additional 1-2 buzzes, I don't know if it's necessary. Maybe that's best reserved for stubborn hairs. You will see some white puss looking fluid come out of the follicle, supposedly that's lye, which kills the follicle. When done with all of your hairs for the session, take a pause before tweezing hairs and cleaning your face. Here is a good time to put away your tools, brush your teeth or whatever. Sanitize your probe with rubbing alcohol. Meanwhile this will give the lye time to work, let's say it's 5-10 minutes. Then you tweeze the hairs and clean your face. You can use your extra rubbing alcohol to wipe on your hair follicles to help sanitize them.<br /><br />Another tip, make sure your probe is fully in the follicle during the shock. The probe needle should dissappear inside, and your skin should not dimple inward from the probe pushing it down. Don't touch the skin with the probe sleeve/nozzle, but be very close. You can also use two hands to hold the probe for stability. Your dominant hand can hold the top part of the pen, and your other hand hold the tapered bottom part and brace the side of your hand against your face. I have shaky hands and this helped me to keep the probe in place.<br /><br />My nose tip hairs seemed to all die out in 1-2 treatments. Cheeks I started with a lot but each time it gets easier with less and less hair. That single ear hair was one and done. Between eyebrows, I started with a bit of a monobrow but it's getting very thin. Overall a success and I plan to continue to treat other areas in the future.",True,1,0,1,2

AFRQFWTYB4BKVJIQA4RJVWVC6VSA,B01HCCXXGG,3.0,"There are only a few reviews on Castle Forbes' Special Reserve Neroli. A couple are on here, a few randomly online. You have to dig for them. So if you're reading this, you're more of a fragrance lover than the average Tommy Bahama fan. Put simply, CF Neroli is not a popular EDP, nor is the brand. You have to know some things about fragrance and have a specific knowledge about neroli itself, to have come searching for Castle Forbes version. This is how I came to know this brand and EDP myself.<br />My view is that it's not worth the cost of 160USD. That's a lot of money for a 3.4oz. bottle. CF has a nice brand image, the EDP presentation is great, and the quality of the materials used are outstanding. However, the scent alone falls short.<br />Neroli Reserve starts out wonderfully: crisp orange and neroli, combined with greens like pine, grass and hedges. You feel like you're at the beach, sitting just where the sand dunes meet a lush forest. This lasts for about 20 minutes. Then the ""woody/musky"" basenotes kick in, and this is where CF got it wrong. It deteriorates into a powdery, barbershop, very British scent. It's something your grandmother (not grandfather) would have worn if she lived in London in 1865. Designer houses today try and replicate this a bit, usually just producing a floraly, loud, baby powder vibe (see MDCI Invasion Barbare). This basenote scent is what then dominates for the next 10 hours, more if you've sprayed any arm/chest hair. The woods aren't masculine woods, just faint tree bark really.<br />The EDP strength is phenomenal; this stuff lasts. The only problem is whether or not you like to smell like a woman, particularly a powderpuff with flowers. I do get some faint whiffs of neroli, but it's overpowered by the floral powder. I would not recommend this for a man, and unfortunately, would recommend Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino over this. A different vibe for sure (more aquatic), but TF's neroli sustains.<br />Overall, 3 of 5 stars just because the ingredients are so good, but the scent isn't as much neroli as it is the musky amber that CF used.

It's supposed to be a good example of a Vetiver fragrance<br />3.) Vetiver seems to be a big category for men's fragrances.<br />4.) As a newcomer to men's fragrances, I had no idea what Vetiver actually smelled like.<br />5.) This stuff is widely discounted and it seemed like a low risk option to learn about Vetiver and answer some of my questions.<br /><br />So how does it smell?  Great!  I loved it from the first moment of the first spray through the dry down right up until it disappeared on my skin.<br /><br />Reviewers use words like ""dark, brooding, mysterious, and serious"" to describe this.  I don't get any of that.  It just smells good.  It makes me happy.  No, it's not a light citrus smell for summer days.  It's a heavier, richer smell that's probably better for an evening out.<br /><br />Personally I find this a lot like the Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP I also bought.  The smell is totally different but with both these fragrances.........<br />1.) I just liked the smell from the first moment.<br />2.) The concentration is Eau De Parfum for both.<br />3.) The longevity, projection, and sillage seems similar.<br /><br />And speaking of performance, this is NOT ""beast mode"" stuff.  It's more subtle.

So for both the D&G The One EDP and this Encre Noir A L'Extreme these impress me as grown up fragrances that come off as sophisticated scents for grown men who wear suits for a living.  I think this would be out of place on a guy in torn jeans, sneakers, and a tee shirt.<br /><br />So performance..........<br />Longevity - I find it's gone in about 5-6 hours.  That's fine.  I can always respray if I want.<br />Projection - Maybe arm's length at most.  That's OK.  It's not ""in your face"", it's subtle.  Someone needs to be within 3 feet to really pick upon it.  If you respray after a few hours you won't offend people.<br />Sillage - Again modest.  I really don't see you offending a room full of people as you walk through and leave them choking and gagging.<br />Uniqueness - This is not your typical men's cologne smell in my limited experience.  It's different.  It may get people thinking / wondering about what that smell is.  In a good way.<br />Compliments -  I've only asked one woman what she thought and I was surprised that she really liked it.  A good start.<br /><br />Personally, I think this lives up to the reviews and the hype.  if this is what a good Vetiver cologne smells like, I like it.  I haven't tried the original Encre Noir or the Sport version.  This L'Extreme version was recommended as the best and most wearable choice and I'm happy I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",True,1,0,1,2
AGS3CGE7NZN7EZIOG3FXTNLWS33Q,B00ENBZZSO,2.0,"I was hoping for a masculine tool kit when I ordered this item. Unfortunately, I did not notice the cutesy little smiley faces carved into the backs of the clippers. The case is okay -- not luxurious (feels cheap) but looks alright, though the latch doesn't hold it closed really at all. It serves as more of an alarm, really. You hear a little &#34;pop&#34; and it comes flying open, so at least you know it's about to spill everywhere for a tenth of a second before it does.<br /><br />But the worst thing about it is the tools themselves, which feel like they're made from maybe a rigid plastic or some of that &#34;compressed powder&#34; material rather than metal. All of them flex and bend out of shape even with the simplest tasks.<br /><br />I would not buy this again, nor would I gift it to an enemy.",True,1,0,1,2
AGS3CGE7NZN7EZIOG3FXTNLWS33Q,B000FEF1V4,5.0,"If we're completely honest, we've been conditioned by manufacturers these days to accept rubbish without complaint.  Quite true, you can dial into their computer and navigate circles around their voicemail system for a few hours until your anger dissipates.  Or is transferred to computer answering systems.  Whichever comes first.<br /><br />Happily, however, such is not the case with the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.<br /><br />Not only does this eager little trimmer solve several problems at once but it does so with a composure and aplomb that will sweep away the corporate fog and, suddenly, everything else you own will seem completely and utterly inadequate.<br /><br />Trimming whiskers used to be such a chore that the ZZ Top look began to show some sense, if not appeal.  The constant recharging, sweeping up afterward, seemingly endless search for single-tasking components that had wandered off and an assembly/disassembly process for cleaning the tool that would make Bill Gates weep.  Philips, however, decided to go in a slightly different direction.<br /><br />For a start, the battery holds on to a charge with a grip that would make Chuck Liddell cry. It doesn't last mere hours, days or weeks.  Under standard use, mine lasts well over a month.  Even when the battery light does begin to blink, what it really means to say is, ""Pardon me but, at some point in the next several days, when it isn't too much of a bother, could you please plug me in for a bit?""  Nothing urgent about it whatsoever.  And once the lead is connected from socket to trimmer, a scant hour will have it fully refreshed and ready for another month on the road.<br /><br />Then there is the all-in-one design.  Unlike most trimmers, which require that you dig around to find the correct attachment in order to trim your left eyebrow now that you're done with the right, nearly everything is built directly into this sleek little unit.  The only exception is a neat little detail trimmer that stands eternally at the ready in its own clear and obvious pocket inside the travel pouch.  That's it.  Nothing else to search out when you're dashing to work.  It's all right there.<br /><br />Not everyone who sells a ""vacuum trimmer"" truly means it.  Most generate just a bit of wind, sufficient to scatter your whiskers over the widest possible surface.  I firmly believe my last vacuum trimmer was designed by a consortium of housekeepers seeking job security.  The T980, however, actually captures every single whisker, every single time.  And then there's a Turbo button that doubles the already adequate force of the vacuum's suction so that you can give yourself that wind-blown look if you so choose.<br /><br />But, by far, my favorite thing about this trimmer is the way it feels.  It sits in your hand as if it were custom designed specifically for you.  It's lightweight and nimble around the bends, falls effortlessly into its case when deeds are done and assembles as if there is an invisible force guiding your hand at every step of the way.  I am genuinely amazed at the simplicity of removing and replacing the grille guard.  For a time, I thought it must be drawn together by magnets.  But it isn't.  It's just a set of exceptionally well designed tabs and slots that quickly correct a hurried approach and seat the grille home with a satisfying, subtle click.<br /><br />Most products on the market today are slapdash clumps of flimsy plastics and mechanics that are carefully designed to fail at the worst possible time.  And, for some reason, we have accepted this corporate abuse in the hopes that prices would compensate us somehow.  But they don't really, do they?  When you've re-purchased the same device five times because it keeps breaking, whose interests are truly being served?<br /><br />So, then, the T980 is a warning shot fired over the bow of companies everywhere who treat their clients like stupid, slobbering monkeys, devoid of choice or rights.  With it, Philips is saying, ""See, everyone?  You needn't accept rubbish in exchange for your hard-earned money.  We've done it properly and at a price point that is competitive.""  And why wouldn't we honor that?<br /><br />I wish my hair grew faster.",True,1,0,1,2

We have over the past 20 years begun DIYing our home.  We did a complete makeover of out 1978 yellow steel tub and yellow toilet with vinyl floor.  It was hideous.. We spent a year researching fixtures and construction methods for making our own walk in shower.  After looking at the costs we found the ariel to be cost contender with the amount of renovation we would have to do and to get the wow factor we were looking for…Don’t get me wrong it was not the cheapest but it was surprisingly cost competitive and seemed fairly simple assemble.  We did just that – the bathroom took 1 week to complete and the shower was 2 days for the 1 week.  I found the instructions fine with a few issues with the electric EFI circuit I was lost on but the folk where we purchased it from were awesome with the tech support.  We got ours from atlasusa.com.  The only issue we had which is well documented is the drain.  I underestimated the importance of installing a dedicated drain and simply used the supplied flexible drain provided.  After a couple days of very slow drainage, I was able to fix the issue quickly and it has worked flawlessly every day since July 2013 (over 6 months).  I use the steam function nearly every day and the shower uses very high quality hardware.  I did remove the hair catcher and the other junk they had in the original drain and if I were to do it again I would have put in a permanent drain and scrapped the provided drain from the beginning.  We smile every time we use the shower and everyone who walks into the bathroom, still 6 months later, comments on the shower.  I could not be happier.  With the new drain we do lift the floor up once a month, just to make sure its clean and working well down there.  The wood is holding up great so far even with daily use and I would recommend this project to anyone.  By the way it was a perfect fit as a replacement for our existing bathtub.  Fits snug wall to wall…If I could attach a picture I would, but it looks and works great!  This was 100% installed by 2 middle aged people in 2 days with 1 phone tech support call....",False,1,0,1,2

The carpet is a tight knurled dark pattern, and also a couple of area rugs that are low pile, and a wood floor. Eventually the vacuum started making noise after a week. Little tiny noises here and there that reminds you of a bearing that starts making noise on your car's serpentine belt pulley system. I'm a mechanic, so when I heard that noise I instantly knew it was a bearing in the spindle. Or time to get louder and louder and I had to replace it and I bought it Factory Direct. And then that was great and quiet for about a week, and then a few noises and trips here and there of the bearing. Obviously these bearings suck and they're letting dust inside of them or something. No other vacuum we've ever had in the last 25 years in this house has had a problem with the bearings going out on the spindles. And look how many reviews there are. Plenty of high reviews for people that are just glad to have a roller that made their $250 vacuum like brand new again instead of having to go and she'll of a couple hundred dollars more for another vacuum. But the sad truth of it, is that it is a low-quality part even though it is Factory Direct. This is the real deal. No second-hand plastic injection mold factory making knockoffs. It is the real deal.

OK, with the warning out of the way, I’ll say that if you’ve never used or seen on these hair-removers you’re in for a treat.  It’s a simple method that you do yourself in the comfort of your own home.  I won’t go into all of the possible use scenarios, I’ll leave that up to you to decide.  So instead I’m going to talk about how it works and one thing that I think makes this one a more versatile option than others out there.<br /><br />So the difference between IPL (this one) and laser hair removers is that the laser ones work only on hair that is actively growing.  You have to kind of time your treatments to line up with the hair-growth cycle until you’ve gotten all the follicles.  IPL (Intense Pulse Light) has a different wavelength of light and it has a broader spectrum which will target hair follicles in all stages.  The caveat is that IPL probably takes more treatments to get the job done, but since this device is rated for 999,999 pulses, I don’t think that would be an issue.<br /><br />The reason I think this particular model more versatile, is that it does not require a seal against the skin in order to fire.  We purchased a different device that required a good seal against the skin (presumably to prevent exposure to the light), and while it worked very nicely, it was a real challenge to use in the curves and crevices of the face where making a perfect seal with a 3-inch flat surface is impossible.<br /><br />This device comes with a very good instruction manual.  If you read it thoroughly and plan your strategy you’re very likely to get good results.  I tried to show it in my video but unfortunately, the lens or the camera sensor just doesn’t pickup the wavelenghts of the light.  Believe me, it’s bright, and it’s really a trip to see the hairs just evaporate.  Just make sure to protect your eyes and follow all of the safety indications.",True,1,0,1,2

Note that historically most hand sanitizer has been based on isopropyl alcohol whereas ethanol has been used in things like alcohol that you drink of as a gasoline additive for oxygenated fuels (for environmental purposes) as well as other purposes.  Isopropyl has been used in hand sanitizer and ""rubbing alcohol"" among other things.  Both are now approved for use in hand sanitizer.  Ethynol-based sanitzers are becoming much more common due to high demand and supply constraints on Isopropyl-based sanitizers.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that the CDC and WHO have different guidelines for hand sanitizer effectiveness for these two types of alcohol:<br />CDC: Ethyl - at least 60%, Isopropyl - at least 70%<br />WHO: Ethyl - at least 80%, Isopropyl - at least 75%<br />You can see that it is interesting that the CDC recommends higher concentrations of Isopropyl whereas WHO recommends higher concentrations of Ethyl.  Curious.  Rather than dig into too many details on the difference, the easiest thing is to find a way to meet both...<br /><br />The most common ethyl alcohol hand sanitizers that we have been getting (and the most common out there) are 70% -- which exceeds CDC 60% threshold, but is below the 80% WHO threshold.<br /><br />THIS SANITIZER has an ISOPROPYL concentration of 75% which exceeds the CDC 70% threshold and meets the WHO 75% threshold.<br /><br />Clearly these thresholds are not hard limits as indicated by the difference of opinion between CDC and WHO, but it is mildly comforting to meet both recommendations if you can do so with no downside or extra expense.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:<br />* Easily squeezes out of bottle in controlled amount as a gel<br />* Rubs in easily and absorbs within less than a minute to leave no noticeable residue or tackiness on your hands<br />* Aloe helps to keep your hands moist, fighting the drying effects of the alcohol<br />* Small bottles are easy to take in car, backpack, purse, etc.<br />* Scent is minor and dissipates quickly (we're not using this for its smell after all)<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />A cost effective way to keep you hands sanitized when you can't use soap & water.

That's to help it wrap around tricky areas (ankle bones, knees, etc.). It's also supposed to work well for large areas. I prefer to wax myself, and I don't have assistance. I also like to wax everywhere. I waxed my own back with this stuff and it actually worked. I did larger sections, and was reaching behind myself to both apply and remove the wax. It did indeed stretch and flex well so there wasn't any wax or hair breakage. The hair on my back is the typically fluffy vellus hair. It showed up after I had my second and I just don't like it even if it's not super obvious (or even visible 90% of the time). Admittedly that hair type did make it difficult to see, but again this wax wasn't too fussy. I'm 100% positive I applied it in the wrong direction at times and removed in the wrong direction too. Still, worked great.<br /><br />I also tested it out on my legs. The hair there really varies from fine and barely visible blonde to thicker and quite dark (and rather stubborn to remove in places). It did a decent job on most of my legs. In the areas where the hair is a bit more stubborn I really had to work in smaller sections to get a good result. But in areas like my thighs I was able to do wide areas with ease and little left behind. On my thighs I have small areas that grow in different directions for no reason.

AGD4PHFQFZ3D7CQ5PWIDCVX74ZYQ,B07KHGF8WX,4.0,"I got this today and tried it out right away. I only had a couple minutes and was happy to discover it blends quickly and easily. I’m fussy about makeup and don’t like the look of anything too obvious. After initial application I used my hands to gently wipe away excess and help it melt into the skin, it made a big difference. As an aside, it was very difficult to wash off my hands so I suspect it won’t transfer all over the place. It lives up to its name and imparts a lovely glow but doesn’t look oily or greasy. So far I’ve had it on for five hours and it still looks pretty good. I did spray my face with a bit of water and blotted with a tissue. That really smoothed the areas that we’re looking a bit dry. I need to swap to a heavier winter moisturizer and and had done no skin prep prior to application. Given that I can’t judge this too harshly.<br /><br />As to the shade, it’s not prefect but close. I wear Cream in Hourglass Vanish foundation. I think that makes me close to NW15-20 in MAC. I feel like the cool tone version of 21 would work better, but this one is neutral enough I can make it work. A lot of times neutrals lean too warm but this one doesn’t seem too which means it’ll work for more people. I think depth wise it’s okay, but If you’re at all darker than me get the next shade up.<br /><br />At under $13 this is pretty incredible. It doesn’t come with a refill, but given the price I’m not going to complain. Please note if you’re buying this only for the compact my AmorePacific cushion doesn’t not fit in this at all. So if you use anything shaped like that it won’t work. You could just swap the sponge with the actual product though.

And I'm a young man, but with old-school taste; straight razors, safety razors, badger brushes, the whole nine yards.  As much as I enjoy a classic shave (I keep a lined up, close to the face beard), it takes a lot of time and prep, which is not practical with a busy schedule.  This little detail trimmer has the T-blade which I have always LOVED, and it is able to be zero-gapped.  However, right out of the box this thing cut razor sharp and is shave-worthy close!  Its super small too; fits in palm of hand.  A single AA battery powers it, and to be honest it doesn't sound or feel powerful, but somehow the results speak for themselves.  This thing trimmed my line-up on my neck and cheeks with precision and never once nicked or pulled a single hair.  Right off the bat it looked like I was shaving with my straight edge, the lines were that crisp.  I highly recommend this product.  Its like $20 something bucks and comes with a lanyard (which I originally thought was kind of stupid but its so small and light, I feel it can easily fall off the sink and break so I would use it just to be careful).

No stripes, twin tubes, sparkles, or any flavor-bursting crystals or strips.  I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.

This is compared to the Crest 3D at 0.243% (or triple) while the Crest Pro Health lists 0.454%.<br /><br />Additionally, I've found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth.

First, I'll start by saying that I ordered it as an add-on item in &#34;dark blue to peacock green.&#34; With Prime, it only took two days to get to my house; very fast and convenient shipping, and the hairpiece was encased in a clear plastic bag; I threw that away, as I keep my extensions in a silk hair case. This hairpiece is actually pretty high quality for synthetic, eccentric hair, so I would suggest something like that to keep it safe and untangled when you're not wearing it.<br /><br />In my opinion, the product images do not really do this hairpiece justice. I can't say anything for other colors yet, but the dark blue to peacock green is pretty true to the product images, with sapphire blue roots and aqua-blue tips (although I will say the hairpiece I received is not half-and-half blue and green like the picture; mine is like an ombre gradient, approximately 2/3 blue and 1/3 aqua tips).<br /><br />Many of the reviews here also have mixed comments on the thickness of the hairpiece; maybe the people who say it is &#34;thin&#34; are comparing it to their own natural hair? I will say that this piece is very thick for a single-weft hair extension. A weft is like a curtain of hair with a seam holding it all together at the top. I wear extensions almost every day after a butchered haircut took 12 inches of my hair. Authentic human hair extensions come in wefts of varying widths, usually one clip wide or four clips wide, and the hair is very thin because the wefts are meant to be layered on in sections, like natural hair. This blue hair extension is 5 clips wide--wide enough to fasten on your head from ear to ear. Because of my experiences with authentic human hair extensions, I was expecting this blue piece to be thin and underwhelming, but I was wrong and am very happy about that.<br /><br />I also have an asymmetrical haircut that is close-cropped on one side, so this extension is actually too wide for me to wear across my nape (as the model does in the product image), but I am still able to use it. I curve it to clip from my left nape to above my right ear and it suits my needs and still looks real, despite its unusual color.<br /><br />Since there is so much hair on a single weft, as other reviewers have stated, this hair extension is a bit heavy. That may take some getting used to, as improper clipping could cause some discomfort and irritation from pulling on the roots. However, once you get practice putting it in, you will learn the best way to clip it without any tugging or pulling of the hair.<br /><br />It is synthetic material, and while I noticed that mine was shiny, it was not like &#34;Barbie hair,&#34; as some reviewers said. I did not need to rub any baby powder in; I just wore it to work for a few hours a day and the shine eventually dulled to look a little less like synthetic material. I will try to add some photos to this page of what the extension looks like in my (straight black) hair. I also noticed that it became easily tangled after a few days of wear. This is not really a problem; I am afraid to brush it too often though, as it sheds (which is normal, but I want it to last).<br /><br />Lastly, despite being synthetic material, I have tried straightening it on the high setting on my Conair flatiron with success. You can also use a razor or scissors to make any modifications to the style or length, if necessary.<br /><br />Overall, I think you will be very satisfied with this product if you buy it. I liked it so much that I placed an order for dark pink/light pink and yellow/lime green. These were not add-on items, however, so I will be waiting until mid-August to September to receive these other hair extensions. Hopefully they will be as nice as the blue/peacock green, because I was not disappointed!",True,1,0,1,2

AHBQPN5IFI3EFXV4F5WSVVCO7VCQ,B00MQ6BE92,4.0,"(This product was sent to me for review.)<br /><br />This is a nice, light cream for skin that is probably less dry, sun damaged, and aged than mine. My other shea-butter products leave a more lasting &#34;deeply moisturized&#34; feeling on my arms and chest. By contrast, this product (applied twice, a few minutes apart) leave a non-greasy, nice, soft feeling that is more appropriate for day use, especially when I have business engagements or don't want to smear cream on nice clothing.<br /><br />I've had little luck in finding on the Oz Naturals website the precise meaning of the first ingredient, &#34;organic herbal infusion.&#34; A few other consumer websites conclude that the term refers to water in which herbs have been macerated. Given that dry skin needs water, I don't mind that this is the first ingredient (followed by palm oil and sweet almond oil), but I would find more forthcoming to say &#34;organic herbal-infused water.&#34; (Also, what kind of water? Tap water? Filtered water?)<br /><br />Also, the gluten-sensitive folks should note that this product contains wheat germ.",False,1,1,0,2

But this product claims to be moisturizing, so I tried it.<br /><br />The product is clear, without the clay in many masks, so there is no spooky cracked mask-effect after 15-20 minutes. But it does dry &#34;taut.&#34;<br /><br />The benefits of rose hip oil seem straightforward enough, but this mask does not feel oily.  I'm also not sure what pro-vitamin B5 and an amino acid complex will do for my skin; I doubt published studies are devoted to this.<br /><br />The mask leaves my skin feeling soft and supple but definitely ready for moisturizer. I don't have the time for a regular routine with this mask, and I'm not sure it's worth it for me.",False,1,1,0,2
